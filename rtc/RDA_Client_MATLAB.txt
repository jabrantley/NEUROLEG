Both M-files need the tcpip package for MATLAB®installed on the running machine. Just extract the Zip with the contained subpaths into a valid MATLAB® path. You may check the installation by typing help pnet on the MATLAB® console, so a help text should appear. The library is free and open source and may be also downloaded from the Mathworks webpage. 
Both clients are independent and contain a lot of comments to describe the intentions. RDA.m is a simple console application, which just implements the necessary RDA features: 
After started via command RDA from a MATLAB® console, it connects to the recorder host and reads the online data in a loop. Stopping the acquisition in Recorder will also stop the program. While running, the program prints eeg properties and marker info as they appear. Every second it calculates the average power over time and channels and prints this value to console.
So this client is a good point to start and understand the interaction between Recorder and MATLAB®. Modifying this script for your own calculations should be no problem.
RDAGUI.m is a more advanced RDA client, which consists of an additional GUI.
It can be started with the command RDAGUI and uses a MATLAB® timer to read the data from Recorder. It also prints eeg properties and marker info to the MATLAB® console. Additionally it displays the first channel of the recorded data and its Fourier transform in some axes areas. Because of the sometimes poor performance of MATBAL® graphics there may occur buffer overflows on slower machines."
