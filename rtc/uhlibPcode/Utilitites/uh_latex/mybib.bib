  abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by a progressive impairment
	of motor skills with deterioration of autonomy in daily living activities.
	Physiotherapy is regarded as an adjuvant to pharmacological and neurosurgical
	treatment and may provide small and short-lasting clinical benefits
	in PD patients. However, the development of innovative rehabilitation
	approaches with greater long-term efficacy is a major unmet need.
	Motor imagery (MI) and action observation (AO) have been recently
	proposed as a promising rehabilitation tool. MI is the ability to
	imagine a movement without actual performance (or muscle activation).
	The same cortical-subcortical network active during motor execution
	is engaged in MI. The physiological basis of AO is represented by
	the activation of the "mirror neuron system." Both MI and AO are
	involved in motor learning and can induce improvements of motor performance,
	possibly mediated by the development of plastic changes in the motor
	cortex. The review of available evidences indicated that MI ability
	and AO feasibility are substantially preserved in PD subjects. A
	few preliminary studies suggested the possibility of using MI and
	AO as parts of rehabilitation protocols for PD patients.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Emerging evidence shows that interactive virtual environments
	(VEs) may be a promising tool for studying sensorimotor processes
	and for rehabilitation. However, the potential of VEs to recruit
	action observation-execution neural networks is largely unknown.
	For the first time, a functional MRI-compatible virtual reality system
	(VR) has been developed to provide a window into studying brain-behavior
	interactions. This system is capable of measuring the complex span
	of hand-finger movements and simultaneously streaming this kinematic
	data to control the motion of representations of human hands in virtual
	reality. METHODS: In a blocked fMRI design, thirteen healthy subjects
	observed, with the intent to imitate (OTI), finger sequences performed
	by the virtual hand avatar seen in 1st person perspective and animated
	by pre-recorded kinematic data. Following this, subjects imitated
	the observed sequence while viewing the virtual hand avatar animated
	by their own movement in real-time. These blocks were interleaved
	with rest periods during which subjects viewed static virtual hand
	avatars and control trials in which the avatars were replaced with
	moving non-anthropomorphic objects. RESULTS: We show three main findings.
	First, both observation with intent to imitate and imitation with
	real-time virtual avatar feedback, were associated with activation
	in a distributed frontoparietal network typically recruited for observation
	and execution of real-world actions. Second, we noted a time-variant
	increase in activation in the left insular cortex for observation
	with intent to imitate actions performed by the virtual avatar. Third,
	imitation with virtual avatar feedback (relative to the control condition)
	was associated with a localized recruitment of the angular gyrus,
	precuneus, and extrastriate body area, regions which are (along with
	insular cortex) associated with the sense of agency. CONCLUSIONS:
	Our data suggest that the virtual hand avatars may have served as
	disembodied training tools in the observation condition and as embodied
	"extensions" of the subject's own body (pseudo-tools) in the imitation.
	These data advance our understanding of the brain-behavior interactions
	when performing actions in VE and have implications in the development
	of observation- and imitation-based VR rehabilitation paradigms.},

  abstract = {Several works have reported on the reconstruction of 2D/3D limb kinematics
	from low-frequency EEG signals using linear regression models based
	on positive correlation values between the recorded and the reconstructed
	trajectories. This paper describes the mathematical properties of
	the linear model and the correlation evaluation metric that may lead
	to a misinterpretation of the results of this type of decoders. Firstly,
	the use of a linear regression model to adjust the two temporal signals
	(EEG and velocity profiles) implies that the relevant component of
	the signal used for decoding (EEG) has to be in the same frequency
	range as the signal to be decoded (velocity profiles). Secondly,
	the use of a correlation to evaluate the fitting of two trajectories
	could lead to overly-optimistic results as this metric is invariant
	to scale. Also, the correlation has a non-linear nature that leads
	to higher values for sinus/cosinus-like signals at low frequencies.
	Analysis of these properties on the reconstruction results was carried
	out through an experiment performed in line with previous studies,
	where healthy participants executed predefined reaching movements
	of the hand in 3D space. While the correlations of limb velocity
	profiles reconstructed from low-frequency EEG were comparable to
	studies in this domain, a systematic statistical analysis revealed
	that these results were not above the chance level. The empirical
	chance level was estimated using random assignments of recorded velocity
	profiles and EEG signals, as well as combinations of randomly generated
	synthetic EEG with recorded velocity profiles and recorded EEG with
	randomly generated synthetic velocity profiles. The analysis shows
	that the positive correlation results in this experiment cannot be
	used as an indicator of successful trajectory reconstruction based
	on a neural correlate. Several directions are herein discussed to
	address the misinterpretation of results as well as the implications
	on previous invasive and non-invasive works.},

  abstract = {A major challenge in EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) is
	the intersession nonstationarity in the EEG data that often leads
	to deteriorated BCI performances. To address this issue, this letter
	proposes a novel data space adaptation technique, EEG data space
	adaptation (EEG-DSA), to linearly transform the EEG data from the
	target space (evaluation session), such that the distribution difference
	to the source space (training session) is minimized. Using the Kullback-Leibler
	(KL) divergence criterion, we propose two versions of the EEG-DSA
	algorithm: the supervised version, when labeled data are available
	in the evaluation session, and the unsupervised version, when labeled
	data are not available. The performance of the proposed EEG-DSA algorithm
	is evaluated on the publicly available BCI Competition IV data set
	IIa and a data set recorded from 16 subjects performing motor imagery
	tasks on different days. The results show that the proposed EEG-DSA
	algorithm in both the supervised and unsupervised versions significantly
	outperforms the results without adaptation in terms of classification
	accuracy. The results also show that for subjects with poor BCI performances
	when no adaptation is applied, the proposed EEG-DSA algorithm in
	both the supervised and unsupervised versions significantly outperforms
	the unsupervised bias adaptation algorithm (PMean).},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Wiener-Granger causality ("G-causality") is a statistical
	notion of causality applicable to time series data, whereby cause
	precedes, and helps predict, effect. It is defined in both time and
	frequency domains, and allows for the conditioning out of common
	causal influences. Originally developed in the context of econometric
	theory, it has since achieved broad application in the neurosciences
	and beyond. Prediction in the G-causality formalism is based on VAR
	(vector autoregressive) modelling. NEW METHOD: The MVGC Matlab(c)
	Toolbox approach to G-causal inference is based on multiple equivalent
	representations of a VAR model by (i) regression parameters, (ii)
	the autocovariance sequence and (iii) the cross-power spectral density
	of the underlying process. It features a variety of algorithms for
	moving between these representations, enabling selection of the most
	suitable algorithms with regard to computational efficiency and numerical
	accuracy. RESULTS: In this paper we explain the theoretical basis,
	computational strategy and application to empirical G-causal inference
	of the MVGC Toolbox. We also show via numerical simulations the advantages
	of our Toolbox over previous methods in terms of computational accuracy
	and statistical inference. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): The
	standard method of computing G-causality involves estimation of parameters
	for both a full and a nested (reduced) VAR model. The MVGC approach,
	by contrast, avoids explicit estimation of the reduced model, thus
	eliminating a source of estimation error and improving statistical
	power, and in addition facilitates fast and accurate estimation of
	the computationally awkward case of conditional G-causality in the
	frequency domain. CONCLUSIONS: The MVGC Toolbox implements a flexible,
	powerful and efficient approach to G-causal inference.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Understanding the behavioral mechanisms of sensorimotor
	adaptation and learning is essential for designing rational rehabilitation
	interventions. RECENT FINDINGS: Adaptation is the trial-and-error
	process of adjusting movement to new demands and is now thought to
	be more than a simple error cancellation process. Instead, it may
	calibrate the brain's prediction of how the body will move and takes
	into account costs associated with the new task demand. Damage of
	the cerebellum systematically disrupts adaptation, but damage to
	other brain regions often does not. Adapting to perturbations driven
	by a device like a robot or a treadmill leads to only partial generalization
	to unconstrained 'real-world' movements. Repeated adaptation can
	lead to learning a new motor calibration, but process of consolidation
	of this type of learning is less understood in patients. SUMMARY:
	Adaptation is inherently important for rehabilitation by making movement
	flexible, but can also be used to ascertain whether some patients
	can generate a more normal motor pattern. Repeated adaptation can
	lead to learning of a new, more permanent motor calibration. Though
	less understood, this type of learning is likely to be an important
	method for making long-term improvements in patients' movement patterns.},

  abstract = {Because sensation is delayed, real-time movement control requires
	not just sensing, but also predicting limb position, a function hypothesized

	to perception of limb position (i.e., proprioception), particularly
	when a person actively moves the limb. Here we show that human cerebellar
	patients have proprioceptive deficits compared with controls during
	active movement, but not when the arm is moved passively. Furthermore,
	when healthy subjects move in a force field with unpredictable dynamics,
	they have active proprioceptive deficits similar to cerebellar patients.
	Therefore, muscle activity alone is likely insufficient to enhance
	proprioception and predictability (i.e., an internal model of the
	body and environment) is important for active movement to benefit
	proprioception. We conclude that cerebellar patients have an active
	proprioceptive deficit consistent with disrupted movement prediction
	rather than an inability to generally enhance peripheral proprioceptive
	signals during action and suggest that active proprioceptive deficits
	should be considered a fundamental cerebellar impairment of clinical

	Traditional clinical assessments of patients with cerebellar lesions

	have been reported in predicting the visual consequences of movement,
	we suspect that the cerebellum broadly participates in perception

	hypothesize that cerebellar integrity is essential for somatosensory
	perception that requires motor activity, but not passive somatosensory
	perception. We compared the perceptual acuity of human cerebellar

	somatosensory perception tasks with minimal visual information. We
	found that patients were worse at active force and stiffness discrimination
	but similar to control subjects with regard to passive cutaneous
	force detection, passive proprioceptive detection, and passive proprioceptive
	discrimination. Furthermore, the severity of movement symptoms as
	assessed by a clinical exam was positively correlated with impairment
	of active force perception. Notably, within the context of these
	perceptual tasks, control subjects and cerebellar patients displayed
	similar movement characteristics, and hence differing movement strategies
	are unlikely to underlie the differences in perception. Our results
	are consistent with the hypothesis that the cerebellum is vital to

	BCI systems that bypass conventional motor output pathways of nerves

	One classical approach to establish EEG-based control is to set up
	a system that is controlled by a specific EEG feature which is known
	to be susceptible to conditioning and to let the subjects learn the
	voluntary control of that feature. In contrast, the Berlin Brain-Computer
	Interface (BBCI) uses well established motor competencies of its
	users and a machine learning approach to extract subject-specific
	patterns from high-dimensional features optimized for detecting the
	user's intent. Thus the long subject training is replaced by a short
	calibration measurement (20 min) and machine learning (1 min). We
	report results from a study in which 10 subjects, who had no or little
	experience with BCI feedback, controlled computer applications by
	voluntary imagination of limb movements: these intentions led to
	modulations of spontaneous brain activity specifically, somatotopically

	it may be advantageous for the nervous system to bring them back
	into register by spatially realigning one or both. It is possible
	that realignment is determined by weights, in which case the lower-weighted
	modality should always realign more than the higher-weighted modality.
	An alternative possibility is that realignment and weighting processes

	visual and proprioceptive estimates of target hand position in a

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Stroke significantly affects thousands of individuals
	annually, leading to considerable physical impairment and functional
	disability. Gait is one of the most important activities of daily
	living affected in stroke survivors. Recent technological developments
	in powered robotics exoskeletons can create powerful adjunctive tools
	for rehabilitation and potentially accelerate functional recovery.
	Here, we present the development and evaluation of a novel lower
	limb robotic exoskeleton, namely H2 (Technaid S.L., Spain), for gait
	rehabilitation in stroke survivors. METHODS: H2 has six actuated
	joints and is designed to allow intensive overground gait training.
	An assistive gait control algorithm was developed to create a force
	field along a desired trajectory, only applying torque when patients
	deviate from the prescribed movement pattern. The device was evaluated
	in 3 hemiparetic stroke patients across 4 weeks of training per individual
	(approximately 12 sessions). The study was approved by the Institutional
	Review Board at the University of Houston. The main objective of
	this initial pre-clinical study was to evaluate the safety and usability
	of the exoskeleton. A Likert scale was used to measure patient's
	perception about the easy of use of the device. RESULTS: Three stroke
	patients completed the study. The training was well tolerated and
	no adverse events occurred. Early findings demonstrate that H2 appears
	to be safe and easy to use in the participants of this study. The
	overground training environment employed as a means to enhance active
	patient engagement proved to be challenging and exciting for patients.
	These results are promising and encourage future rehabilitation training
	with a larger cohort of patients. CONCLUSIONS: The developed exoskeleton
	enables longitudinal overground training of walking in hemiparetic
	patients after stroke. The system is robust and safe when applied
	to assist a stroke patient performing an overground walking task.
	Such device opens the opportunity to study means to optimize a rehabilitation
	treatment that can be customized for individuals. TRIAL REGISTRATION:
	This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02114450

	learning, subjects were able to accomplish two-dimensional control
	of a cursor with performance levels comparable to those of invasive
	BCI systems. Compared to other studies of noninvasive BCI systems,
	training time was substantially reduced, requiring only a single

	practice ( approximately 20 min). In addition, we used standardized

	Here, we challenge this assumption by continuously decoding three-dimensional

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) offers powerful therapy options within
	a functional, purposeful and motivating context. Several studies
	have shown that patients' motivation plays a crucial role in determining
	therapy outcome. However, few studies have demonstrated the potential
	of VR in pediatric rehabilitation. Therefore, we developed a VR-based
	soccer scenario, which provided interactive elements to engage patients
	during robotic assisted treadmill training (RAGT). The aim of this
	study was to compare the immediate effect of different supportive
	conditions (VR versus non-VR conditions) on motor output in patients
	and healthy control children during training with the driven gait
	orthosis Lokomat*. METHODS: A total of 18 children (ten patients
	with different neurological gait disorders, eight healthy controls)
	took part in this study. They were instructed to walk on the Lokomat
	in four different, randomly-presented conditions: (1) walk normally
	without supporting assistance, (2) with therapists' instructions
	to promote active participation, (3) with VR as a motivating tool
	to walk actively and (4) with the VR tool combined with therapists'
	instructions. The Lokomat gait orthosis is equipped with sensors
	at hip and knee joint to measure man-machine interaction forces.
	Additionally, subjects' acceptance of the RAGT with VR was assessed
	using a questionnaire. RESULTS: The mixed ANOVA revealed significant
	main effects for the factor CONDITIONS (p < 0.001) and a significant
	interaction CONDITIONS x GROUP (p = 0.01). Tests of between-subjects
	effects showed no significant main effect for the GROUP (p = 0.592).
	Active participation in patients and control children increased significantly
	when supported and motivated either by therapists' instructions or
	by a VR scenario compared with the baseline measurement "normal walking"
	(p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The VR scenario used here induces an immediate
	effect on motor output to a similar degree as the effect resulting
	from verbal instructions by the therapists. Further research needs
	to focus on the implementation of interactive design elements, which
	keep motivation high across and beyond RAGT sessions, especially
	in pediatric rehabilitation.},

	We employed an artifact subspace reconstruction (ASR) algorithm to

	reduce the dimensionality of our spatio-temporal features and subsequently
	used a Gaussian mixture model classifier for our three class problem.
	Our results demonstrate significantly better than chance classification
	accuracy (chance level = 33.3%) for the self-initiated (78.0 +/-

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The precise mechanisms of and biological basis for motor
	recovery after stroke in adults are still largely unknown. Reorganization
	of the motor system after stroke as assessed by functional neuroimaging
	is an intriguing but challenging new field of research. Provocative
	but equivocal findings have been reported to date. SUMMARY OF REVIEW:
	We present an overview of functional neuroimaging studies (positron
	emission tomography or functional MRI) of motor tasks in patients
	recovered or still recovering from motor deficit after stroke. After
	a brief account of the connectivity of motor systems and the imaging
	findings in normal subjects, the literature concerning stroke patients
	is reviewed and discussed, and a general model is proposed. CONCLUSIONS:
	Both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have demonstrated that
	the damaged adult brain is able to reorganize to compensate for motor
	deficits. Rather than a complete substitution of function, the main
	mechanism underlying recovery of motor abilities involves enhanced
	activity in preexisting networks, including the disconnected motor
	cortex in subcortical stroke and the infarct rim after cortical stroke.
	Involvement of nonmotor and contralesional motor areas has been consistently
	reported, with the emerging notion that the greater the involvement
	of the ipsilesional motor network, the better is the recovery. This
	hypothesis is supported by the enhanced activity of the ipsilesional
	primary motor cortex induced by motor training and acute pharmacological
	interventions, in parallel with improved motor function. Further
	longitudinal studies assessing the relationships between such changes
	and actual recovery, as well as manipulating such changes by rehabilitation
	or pharmacological maneuvers, should provide further information
	on these fundamental questions. This review closes with some perspectives
	for future research.},

  abstract = {Oscillatory phase coupling within large-scale brain networks is a
	topic of increasing interest within systems, cognitive, and theoretical
	neuroscience. Evidence shows that brain rhythms play a role in controlling
	neuronal excitability and response modulation (Haider B, McCormick
	D. Neuron 62: 171-189, 2009) and regulate the efficacy of communication
	between cortical regions (Fries P. Trends Cogn Sci 9: 474-480, 2005)
	and distinct spatiotemporal scales (Canolty RT, Knight RT. Trends
	Cogn Sci 14: 506-515, 2010). In this view, anatomically connected
	brain areas form the scaffolding upon which neuronal oscillations
	rapidly create and dissolve transient functional networks (Lakatos
	P, Karmos G, Mehta A, Ulbert I, Schroeder C. Science 320: 110-113,
	2008). Importantly, testing these hypotheses requires methods designed
	to accurately reflect dynamic changes in multivariate phase coupling
	within brain networks. Unfortunately, phase coupling between neurophysiological
	signals is commonly investigated using suboptimal techniques. Here
	we describe how a recently developed probabilistic model, phase coupling
	estimation (PCE; Cadieu C, Koepsell K Neural Comput 44: 3107-3126,
	2010), can be used to investigate changes in multivariate phase coupling,
	and we detail the advantages of this model over the commonly employed
	phase-locking value (PLV; Lachaux JP, Rodriguez E, Martinerie J,
	Varela F. Human Brain Map 8: 194-208, 1999). We show that the N-dimensional
	PCE is a natural generalization of the inherently bivariate PLV.
	Using simulations, we show that PCE accurately captures both direct
	and indirect (network mediated) coupling between network elements
	in situations where PLV produces erroneous results. We present empirical
	results on recordings from humans and nonhuman primates and show
	that the PCE-estimated coupling values are different from those using
	the bivariate PLV. Critically on these empirical recordings, PCE
	output tends to be sparser than the PLVs, indicating fewer significant
	interactions and perhaps a more parsimonious description of the data.
	Finally, the physical interpretation of PCE parameters is straightforward:
	the PCE parameters correspond to interaction terms in a network of
	coupled oscillators. Forward modeling of a network of coupled oscillators
	with parameters estimated by PCE generates synthetic data with statistical
	characteristics identical to empirical signals. Given these advantages
	over the PLV, PCE is a useful tool for investigating multivariate
	phase coupling in distributed brain networks.},

	One putative mechanism of control is the desynchronization of electroencephalography

	of a visual target. We show that brief interference by repetitive
	transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) with preparatory activity

	impairs identification of target visual stimuli âˆ¼2 s later. This

	topography in parieto-occipital cortex. Finally, the disruption of
	anticipatory alpha rhythms in occipital cortex after right IPS- or

	These results support the causal role of the dorsal frontoparietal

  abstract = {Despite distinct differences between walking and running, the two
	types of human locomotion are likely to be controlled by shared pattern-generating
	networks. However, the differences between their kinematics and kinetics
	imply that corresponding muscle activations may also be quite different.
	We examined the differences between walking and running by recording
	kinematics and electromyographic (EMG) activity in 32 ipsilateral
	limb and trunk muscles during human locomotion, and compared the
	effects of speed (3-12 km/h) and gait. We found that the timing of
	muscle activation was accounted for by five basic temporal activation
	components during running as we previously found for walking. Each
	component was loaded on similar sets of leg muscles in both gaits
	but generally on different sets of upper trunk and shoulder muscles.
	The major difference between walking and running was that one temporal
	component, occurring during stance, was shifted to an earlier phase
	in the step cycle during running. These muscle activation differences
	between gaits did not simply depend on locomotion speed as shown
	by recordings during each gait over the same range of speeds (5-9
	km/h). The results are consistent with an organization of locomotion
	motor programs having two parts, one that organizes muscle activation
	during swing and another during stance and the transition to swing.
	The timing shift between walking and running reflects therefore the
	difference in the relative duration of the stance phase in the two
	gaits.},

	The system uses a multiple-hypothesis method to predict the driver's

	Without assistance, participants experienced multiple collisions

	their driving, resulting in a reduced cognitive workload. We discuss

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In healthy humans, observation of another
	individual performing a motor training task (action observation [AO])
	facilitates, in the observer, the effects of physical training (PT)
	on motor memory formation. It is not known whether this facilitatory
	process, of potential value for neurorehabilitation, occurs after
	stroke. METHODS: Eight chronic stroke patients completed this crossover-randomized
	investigation. A transcranial magnetic stimulation protocol that
	tests formation of motor memories was used to determine the effects
	of PT alone and in combination with AO in 2 different forms: congruent
	(PT+AO(congruent)) and incongruent (PT+AO(incongruent)) to the practiced
	task. RESULTS: The magnitude of motor memory formation was larger
	with PT+AO(congruent) than with PT alone or PT+AO(incongruent). This
	effect was associated with a differential corticomotor excitability
	change in the muscles acting as agonist and antagonist of the trained/observed
	movements. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that congruent AO
	in association with physical training can enhance the effects of
	motor training after stroke.},

  abstract = {Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide a defined link between neural
	activity and devices, allowing a detailed study of the neural adaptive
	responses generating behavioral output. We trained monkeys to perform
	two-dimensional center-out movements of a computer cursor using a
	BCI. We then applied a perturbation by randomly selecting a subset
	of the recorded units and rotating their directional contributions
	to cursor movement by a consistent angle. Globally, this perturbation
	mimics a visuomotor transformation, and in the first part of this
	article we characterize the psychophysical indications of motor adaptation
	and compare them with known results from adaptation of natural reaching
	movements. Locally, however, only a subset of the neurons in the
	population actually contributes to error, allowing us to probe for
	signatures of neural adaptation that might be specific to the subset
	of neurons we perturbed. One compensation strategy would be to selectively
	adapt the subset of cells responsible for the error. An alternate
	strategy would be to globally adapt the entire population to correct
	the error. Using a recently developed mathematical technique that
	allows us to differentiate these two mechanisms, we found evidence
	of both strategies in the neural responses. The dominant strategy
	we observed was global, accounting for approximately 86% of the total
	error reduction. The remaining 14% came from local changes in the
	tuning functions of the perturbed units. Interestingly, these local
	changes were specific to the details of the applied rotation: in
	particular, changes in the depth of tuning were only observed when
	the percentage of perturbed cells was small. These results imply
	that there may be constraints on the network's adaptive capabilities,
	at least for perturbations lasting only a few hundreds of trials.},

	Optogenetic enhancement and suppression of SOM-IN activity during

  abstract = {Hemispherectomy is currently the only effective treatment for relieving
	constant seizures in children with severe or progressive unilateral
	cortical disease. Although early hemispherectomy has been advocated
	to avoid general dysfunction due to continued seizures, it remains
	unclear whether age at surgery affects specific sensorimotor functions.
	Little is know about the anatomical status of sensorimotor pathways
	after hemispherectomy and how it might relate to sensorimotor function.
	Here we measured motor function and sensory thresholds of the upper
	and lower limbs in 12 hemispherectomized patients. Diffusion tensor
	imaging (DTI) was used to determine status of brainstem corticospinal
	tracts and medial lemniscus. Hemispherectomy subjects showed remarkable
	recovery in both sensory and motor function. Many patients showed
	normal sensory vibration thresholds. Within the smaller Rasmussen's
	subgroup, we saw a relationship between age at surgery and sensorimotor
	function recovery (i.e. earlier was better). Anatomically, we found
	marked asymmetry in brainstem corticospinal tracts but preserved
	symmetry in the medial lemniscus, which may relate to robust sensory

  abstract = {Most theories of motor cortex have assumed that neural activity represents
	movement parameters. This view derives from what is known about primary
	visual cortex, where neural activity represents patterns of light.
	Yet it is unclear how well the analogy between motor and visual cortex
	holds. Single-neuron responses in motor cortex are complex, and there
	is marked disagreement regarding which movement parameters are represented.
	A better analogy might be with other motor systems, where a common
	principle is rhythmic neural activity. Here we find that motor cortex
	responses during reaching contain a brief but strong oscillatory
	component, something quite unexpected for a non-periodic behaviour.
	Oscillation amplitude and phase followed naturally from the preparatory
	state, suggesting a mechanistic role for preparatory neural activity.
	These results demonstrate an unexpected yet surprisingly simple structure
	in the population response. This underlying structure explains many
	of the confusing features of individual neural responses.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We have developed a brain-computer interface (BCI) system
	based on real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with
	virtual reality feedback. The advantage of fMRI is the relatively
	high spatial resolution and the coverage of the whole brain; thus
	we expect that it may be used to explore novel BCI strategies, based
	on new types of mental activities. However, fMRI suffers from a low
	temporal resolution and an inherent delay, since it is based on a
	hemodynamic response rather than electrical signals. Thus, our objective
	in this paper was to explore whether subjects could perform a BCI
	task in a virtual environment using our system, and how their performance
	was affected by the delay. APPROACH: The subjects controlled an avatar
	by left-hand, right-hand and leg motion or imagery. The BCI classification
	is based on locating the regions of interest (ROIs) related with
	each of the motor classes, and selecting the ROI with maximum average
	values online. The subjects performed a cue-based task and a free-choice
	task, and the analysis includes evaluation of the performance as
	well as subjective reports. MAIN RESULTS: Six subjects performed
	the task with high accuracy when allowed to move their fingers and
	toes, and three subjects achieved high accuracy using imagery alone.
	In the cue-based task the accuracy was highest 8-12 s after the trigger,
	whereas in the free-choice task the subjects performed best when
	the feedback was provided 6 s after the trigger. SIGNIFICANCE: We
	show that subjects are able to perform a navigation task in a virtual
	environment using an fMRI-based BCI, despite the hemodynamic delay.
	The same approach can be extended to other mental tasks and other
	brain areas.},

  abstract = {Small errors may affect the process of learning in a fundamentally
	different way than large errors. For example, adapting reaching movements

	mechanisms engaged in response to large versus small errors? Here,
	we examined the motor learning process in patients with severe degeneration
	of the cerebellum. Consistent with earlier reports, we found that
	the patients were profoundly impaired in adapting their motor commands
	during reaching movements in response to large, sudden perturbations.
	However, when the same magnitude perturbation was imposed gradually
	over many trials, the patients showed marked improvements, uncovering
	a latent ability to learn from errors. On sudden removal of the perturbation,
	the patients exhibited aftereffects that persisted much longer than
	did those in healthy controls. That is, despite cerebellar damage,
	the brain maintained the ability to learn from small errors and the
	motor memory that resulted from this learning was strongly resistant
	to change. Of note was the fact that on completion of learning, the
	motor output of the cerebellar patients remained distinct from healthy
	controls in terms of its temporal characteristics. Therefore cerebellar
	degeneration impaired the ability to learn from large-magnitude errors,
	but had a lesser impact on learning from small errors. The neural

  abstract = {Closed-loop decoder adaptation (CLDA) is an emerging paradigm for
	both improving and maintaining online performance in brain-machine
	interfaces (BMIs). The time required for initial decoder training
	and any subsequent decoder recalibrations could be potentially reduced
	by performing continuous adaptation, in which decoder parameters
	are updated at every time step during these procedures, rather than
	waiting to update the decoder at periodic intervals in a more batch-based
	process. Here, we present recursive maximum likelihood (RML), a CLDA
	algorithm that performs continuous adaptation of a Kalman filter
	decoder's parameters. We demonstrate that RML possesses a variety
	of useful properties and practical algorithmic advantages. First,
	we show how RML leverages the accuracy of updates based on a batch
	of data while still adapting parameters on every time step. Second,
	we illustrate how the RML algorithm is parameterized by a single,
	intuitive half-life parameter that can be used to adjust the rate
	of adaptation in real time. Third, we show how even when the number
	of neural features is very large, RML's memory-efficient recursive
	update rules can be reformulated to also be computationally fast
	so that continuous adaptation is still feasible. To test the algorithm
	in closed-loop experiments, we trained three macaque monkeys to perform
	a center-out reaching task by using either spiking activity or local
	field potentials to control a 2D computer cursor. RML achieved higher
	levels of performance more rapidly in comparison to a previous CLDA
	algorithm that adapts parameters on a more intermediate timescale.
	Overall, our results indicate that RML is an effective CLDA algorithm
	for achieving rapid performance acquisition using continuous adaptation.},

	tests 3 weeks apart prior to and following the training program.
	Biomechanical gait analyses indicated the training produced improved
	frontal-plane hip, pelvis, and trunk motion during overground walking.
	Improvement in trunk motion was observed at the posttraining test,
	and improvements in pelvis and hip motion were observed at the 3-week
	follow-up test. Decreases of up to 23% in oxygen consumption also
	were demonstrated. DISCUSSION:Although the exact contribution of
	the visual feedback could not be isolated, the training was effective
	in improving the patient's walking performance. Biomechanical data
	suggest correcting trunk motion and increasing hip abductor strength
	(force-generating capacity) may be important in facilitating improvements
	at the pelvis and hip. Observed improvements in oxygen consumption
	were significantly larger than achieved through previously reported
	interventions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Injuries to the lower extremity often cause limitations
	to joint motion and alter movement patterns of limb segments during
	gait. We hypothesized that complexity and variability of limb segment
	motion during gait would increase in both limbs due to unilateral
	injury. Using simulated injury to generate asymmetric gait, we developed
	new methods to quantify changes in the complexity and variability
	of limb segment angular phase portraits. METHODS: To simulate reduced
	range of motion associated with knee injury, the right knee was constrained
	to full extension by an external brace. Thigh, shank and foot segment
	angular phase portraits were generated from 20 healthy male subjects
	walking for 3-minute trials with and without the brace. Using Fourier-based
	methods, complexity was quantified by the number of harmonic frequencies
	suitable for fitting the phase-portrait shape - with a larger number
	of harmonics indicating greater complexity. Variability was characterized
	by the drift and confidence area generated by the inter-cycle excursion
	of the phase-portrait centroid. FINDINGS: Significant differences
	were found in complexity and variability measures due to bracing.
	Phase-portrait shape complexity and variability increased in the
	right (braced) limb, compared to the unbraced condition; while only
	variability increased for the left (contralateral) limb during bracing.
	INTERPRETATION: These new methods proved successful at quantifying
	changes in the complexity and variability that have been visually
	observed in phase portraits during asymmetric gait. This work provides
	a method that can be incorporated into clinical assessments to provide
	quantifiable measures of more precise differences in gait dynamics.},

  abstract = {Variability is ubiquitous in human movement, arising from internal
	and external noise, inherent biological redundancy, and from the
	neurophysiological control actions that help regulate movement fluctuations.
	Increased walking variability can lead to increased energetic cost
	and/or increased fall risk. Conversely, biological noise may be beneficial,
	even necessary, to enhance motor performance. Indeed, encouraging
	more variability actually facilitates greater improvements in some
	forms of locomotor rehabilitation. Thus, it is critical to identify
	the fundamental principles humans use to regulate stride-to-stride
	fluctuations in walking. This study sought to determine how humans
	regulate stride-to-stride fluctuations in stepping movements during
	treadmill walking. We developed computational models based on pre-defined
	goal functions to compare if subjects, from each stride to the next,
	tried to maintain the same speed as the treadmill, or instead stay
	in the same position on the treadmill. Both strategies predicted
	average behaviors empirically indistinguishable from each other and
	from that of humans. These strategies, however, predicted very different
	stride-to-stride fluctuation dynamics. Comparisons to experimental
	data showed that human stepping movements were generally well-predicted
	by the speed-control model, but not by the position-control model.
	Human subjects also exhibited no indications they corrected deviations
	in absolute position only intermittently: i.e., closer to the boundaries
	of the treadmill. Thus, humans clearly do not adopt a control strategy
	whose primary goal is to maintain some constant absolute position
	on the treadmill. Instead, humans appear to regulate their stepping
	movements in a way most consistent with a strategy whose primary
	goal is to try to maintain the same speed as the treadmill at each
	consecutive stride. These findings have important implications both
	for understanding how biological systems regulate walking in general
	and for being able to harness these mechanisms to develop more effective
	rehabilitation interventions to improve locomotor performance.},

	tetraplegia or paraplegia due to spinal cord injury (SCI) leads to
	many medical co-morbidities, such as cardiovascular disease, metabolic
	derangements, osteoporosis, and pressure ulcers. Treatment of these
	conditions contributes to the majority of SCI health care costs.
	Restoring able-body-like ambulation in this patient population can
	potentially reduce the incidence of these medical co-morbidities,
	in addition to increasing independence and quality of life. However,
	no biomedical solution exists that can reverse this loss of neurological
	function, and hence novel methods are needed. Brain-computer interface
	(BCI) controlled lower extremity prostheses may constitute one such
	novel approach. METHODS: One able-bodied subject and one subject
	with paraplegia due to SCI underwent electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings
	while engaged in alternating epochs of idling and walking kinesthetic
	motor imagery (KMI). These data were analyzed to generate an EEG
	prediction model for online BCI operation. A commercial robotic gait
	orthosis (RoGO) system (suspended over a treadmill) was interfaced
	with the BCI computer to allow for computerized control. The subjects
	were then tasked to perform five, 5-min-long online sessions where
	they ambulated using the BCI-RoGO system as prompted by computerized
	cues. The performance of this system was assessed with cross-correlation
	analysis, and omission and false alarm rates. RESULTS: The offline
	accuracy of the EEG prediction model averaged 86.30% across both
	subjects (chance: 50%). The cross-correlation between instructional
	cues and the BCI-RoGO walking epochs averaged across all subjects
	and all sessions was 0.812Â±0.048 (p-value <10(âˆ’4)). Also, there
	were on average 0.8 false alarms per session and no omissions. CONCLUSION:
	These results provide preliminary evidence that restoring brain-controlled
	ambulation after SCI is feasible. Future work will test the function
	of this system in a population of subjects with SCI. If successful,
	this may justify the future development of BCI-controlled lower extremity
	prostheses for free overground walking for those with complete motor
	SCI. Finally, this system can also be applied to incomplete motor
	SCI, where it could lead to improved neurological outcomes beyond
	those of standard physiotherapy.},

	training could induce any type of clinical recovery. Eight chronic

	to long-term training (12 months) with a multi-stage BMI-based gait
	neurorehabilitation paradigm aimed at restoring locomotion. This
	paradigm combined intense immersive virtual reality training, enriched
	visual-tactile feedback, and walking with two EEG-controlled robotic
	actuators, including a custom-designed lower limb exoskeleton capable
	of delivering tactile feedback to subjects. Following 12 months of
	training with this paradigm, all eight patients experienced neurological
	improvements in somatic sensation (pain localization, fine/crude
	touch, and proprioceptive sensing) in multiple dermatomes. Patients
	also regained voluntary motor control in key muscles below the SCI
	level, as measured by EMGs, resulting in marked improvement in their
	walking index. As a result, 50% of these patients were upgraded to
	an incomplete paraplegia classification. Neurological recovery was
	paralleled by the reemergence of lower limb motor imagery at cortical
	level. We hypothesize that this unprecedented neurological recovery
	results from both cortical and spinal cord plasticity triggered by
	long-term BMI usage.},

	to provide continuous, intuitive, and accurate control, while retaining
	a high level of user autonomy. By employing electroencephalography
	(EEG) to record and decode sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs) induced from
	motor imaginations, a consistent, user-specific control signal may
	be characterized. Utilizing a novel method of interactive and continuous
	control, we trained three normal subjects to modulate their SMRs
	to achieve three-dimensional movement of a virtual helicopter that
	is fast, accurate, and continuous. In this system, the virtual helicopter's
	forward-backward translation and elevation controls were actuated
	through the modulation of sensorimotor rhythms that were converted
	to forces applied to the virtual helicopter at every simulation time
	step, and the helicopter's angle of left or right rotation was linearly
	mapped, with higher resolution, from sensorimotor rhythms associated
	with other motor imaginations. These different resolutions of control
	allow for interplay between general intent actuation and fine control
	as is seen in the gross and fine movements of the arm and hand. Subjects
	controlled the helicopter with the goal of flying through rings (targets)
	randomly positioned and oriented in a three-dimensional space. The

	to be valid and verify with experimental data from walking in a force
	field that they indeed fall in this range. Finally, we attempted
	to falsify the model by performing experiments in two conditions

	when both joints moved in the same direction (in-phase), in different
	directions (antiphase, AP) or if either joint was immobile (JS).
	In-phase joint motion was further subdivided into in-phase flexion
	(IPF) and in-phase extension (IPE), which comprises in-phase during
	stance phase (IPEst) and in-phase during swing phase (IPEsw). Data
	were processed using two threshold values for angular velocity below

	used were 0.05 degrees /% of gait cycle and 0.025 degrees /% of gait
	cycle. Children with cerebral palsy had reduced ROM and walked more

	N and cerebral palsy coordination phases with marginally greater
	significance at the 0.05 degrees /% threshold for most component

  abstract = {Visual input provides vital information for helping us modify our
	walking pattern. For example, artificial optic flow can drive changes
	in step length during locomotion and may also be useful for augmenting
	locomotor training for individuals with gait asymmetries. Here we
	asked whether optic flow could modify the acquisition of a symmetric
	walking pattern during split-belt treadmill adaptation. Participants
	walked on a split-belt treadmill while watching a virtual scene that
	produced artificial optic flow. For the Stance Congruent group, the
	scene moved at the slow belt speed at foot strike on the slow belt
	and then moved at the fast belt speed at foot strike on the fast
	belt. This approximates what participants would see if they moved
	over ground with the same walking pattern. For the Stance Incongruent
	group, the scene moved fast during slow stance and vice versa. In
	this case, flow speed does not match what the foot is experiencing,
	but predicts the belt speed for the next foot strike. Results showed
	that the Stance Incongruent group learned more quickly than the Stance
	Congruent group even though each group learned the same amount during
	adaptation. The increase in learning rate was primarily driven by
	changes in spatial control of each limb, rather than temporal control.
	Interestingly, when this alternating optic flow pattern was presented
	alone, no adaptation occurred. Our results demonstrate that an unnatural
	pattern of optic flow, one that predicts the belt speed on the next
	foot strike, can be used to enhance learning rate during split-belt
	locomotor adaptation.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Motor neuroscience and brain-machine interface (BMI) design
	is based on examining how the brain controls voluntary movement,
	typically by recording neural activity and behavior from animal models.
	Recording technologies used with these animal models have traditionally
	limited the range of behaviors that can be studied, and thus the
	generality of science and engineering research. We aim to design
	a freely-moving animal model using neural and behavioral recording
	technologies that do not constrain movement. APPROACH: We have established
	a freely-moving rhesus monkey model employing technology that transmits
	neural activity from an intracortical array using a head-mounted
	device and records behavior through computer vision using markerless
	motion capture. We demonstrate the flexibility and utility of this
	new monkey model, including the first recordings from motor cortex
	while rhesus monkeys walk quadrupedally on a treadmill. MAIN RESULTS:
	Using this monkey model, we show that multi-unit threshold-crossing
	neural activity encodes the phase of walking and that the average
	firing rate of the threshold crossings covaries with the speed of
	individual steps. On a population level, we find that neural state-space
	trajectories of walking at different speeds have similar rotational
	dynamics in some dimensions that evolve at the step rate of walking,
	yet robustly separate by speed in other state-space dimensions. SIGNIFICANCE:
	Freely-moving animal models may allow neuroscientists to examine
	a wider range of behaviors and can provide a flexible experimental
	paradigm for examining the neural mechanisms that underlie movement
	generation across behaviors and environments. For BMIs, freely-moving
	animal models have the potential to aid prosthetic design by examining
	how neural encoding changes with posture, environment and other real-world
	context changes. Understanding this new realm of behavior in more
	naturalistic settings is essential for overall progress of basic
	motor neuroscience and for the successful translation of BMIs to
	people with paralysis.},

  abstract = {Goal-directed reaching movements are guided by visual feedback from
	both target and hand. The classical view is that the brain extracts
	information about target and hand positions from a visual scene,
	calculates a difference vector between them, and uses this estimate
	to control the movement. Here we show that during fast feedback control,
	this computation is not immediate, but evolves dynamically over time.
	Immediately after a change in the visual scene, the motor system
	generates independent responses to the errors in hand and target
	location. Only about 200 ms later, the changes in target and hand
	positions are combined appropriately in the response, slowly converging
	to the true difference vector. Therefore, our results provide evidence
	for the temporal evolution of spatial computations in the human visuomotor
	system, in which the accurate difference vector computation is first
	estimated by a fast approximation.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The dominant
	view regarding the neural control of reaching is that the visuomotor
	system controls movement based on the difference vectorâ€”the difference
	between the positions of the hand and target. We directly test this
	theory by measuring the responses to visual perturbations over a
	large range of possible variations in both target and hand displacements.
	By modeling the nonlinearity of the feedback response, we were able
	to reveal the temporal evolution of the underlying computations.
	The visuomotor system first uses an approximation to the difference
	vector computation, simply combining the nonlinear responses to cursor
	and target displacements, only arriving at the correct difference
	vector calculation 200 ms later.},

	variability using this method, which raises concerns regarding validity.
	Interpretation of EMG data is strongly influenced by the normalisation

	process, however, is limited. For example, little is known about
	the accuracy of arm proprioception: Does it vary with changes in
	arm configuration, since some peripheral receptors are engaged only
	when joints move toward extreme angles? Are these variations consistent
	across different tasks? Does proprioceptive ability change depending
	on what we try to localize (e.g., fingertip position vs. elbow angle)?
	We used a robot exoskeleton to study proprioception in 14 arm configurations

	to elbow angles after passive movements, 2) match a pointer to fingertip
	positions after passive movements, and 3) actively match their elbow
	angle to a pointer. Across all three tasks, subjects overestimated
	more extreme joint positions; this may be due to peripheral sensory
	signals biasing estimates as a safety mechanism to prevent injury.
	We also found that elbow angle estimates were more precise when used
	to judge fingertip position versus directly reported, suggesting
	that the brain has better access to limb endpoint position than joint
	angles. Finally, precision of elbow angle estimates improved in active

  abstract = {Research into the development of brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) has
	led to demonstrations of rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans controlling
	prosthetic devices in real time through modulation of neural signals.
	In particular, cortical BMI studies have shown that improvements
	in performance require learning and are associated with changes in
	neuronal tuning properties. These studies have further shown evidence
	of long-term improvements in performance with practice. The authors
	conducted experiments to understand long-term skill acquisition with
	BMIs and to characterize the neural correlates of improvements in
	task performance. They specifically assessed long-term acquisition
	of neuroprosthetic skill (i.e., accurate task performance readily
	recalled across days). In 2 monkeys performing a center-out task
	using a brain-controlled (BC) computer cursor, they closely monitored
	daily performance trends and the neural correlates under different
	conditions. Importantly, they assessed BC performance using a continuous-control
	multistep task. The authors first conducted experiments that mimicked
	experimental conditions commonly used. Specifically, a large set
	of neurons was incorporated with daily recalibration of the transform
	of neural activity to BC. Under such conditions, they found evidence
	of variable daily performance. In contrast, when a fixed transform
	was applied to stable recordings from an ensemble of neurons across
	days, there was consistent evidence of long-term skill acquisition.
	Such skill acquisition was associated with the crystallization of
	a cortical map for prosthetic control. Taken together, the results
	suggest that the primate motor cortex can achieve skilled control
	of a neuroprosthetic device through consolidation of a cortical representation.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Abundant literature suggests the use of slow cortical potentials
	(SCPs) in a wide spectrum of basic and applied neuroscience areas.
	Due to their low signal to noise ratio, these potentials are often
	studied using grand-average analysis, which conceals trial-to-trial
	information. Moreover, most of the single trial analysis methods
	in the literature are based on classical electroencephalogram (EEG)
	features ([1-30] Hz) and are likely to be unsuitable for SCPs that
	have different signal properties (such as having the signal's spectral
	content in the range [0.2-0.7] Hz). In this paper we provide insights
	into the selection of appropriate parameters for spectral and spatial
	filtering. APPROACH: We study anticipation related SCPs recorded
	using a web-browser application protocol and a full-band EEG (FbEEG)
	setup from 11 subjects on two different days. MAIN RESULTS: We first
	highlight the role of a bandpass with [0.1-1.0] Hz in comparison
	with common practices (e.g., either with full dc, just a lowpass,
	or with a minimal highpass cut-off around 0.05 Hz). Secondly, we
	suggest that a combination of spatial-smoothing filter and common
	average reference (CAR) is more suitable than the spatial filters
	often reported in the literature (e.g., re-referencing to an electrode,
	Laplacian or CAR alone). Thirdly, with the help of these preprocessing
	steps, we demonstrate the generalization capabilities of linear classifiers
	across several days (AUC of 0.88 +/- 0.05 on average with a minimum
	of 0.81 +/- 0.03 and a maximum of 0.97 +/- 0.01). We also report
	the possibility of further improvements using a Bayesian fusion technique
	applied to electrode-specific classifiers. SIGNIFICANCE: We believe
	the suggested spatial and spectral preprocessing methods are advantageous
	for grand-average and single trial analysis of SCPs obtained from
	EEG, MEG as well as for electrocorticogram. The use of these methods
	will impact basic neurophysiological studies as well as the use of
	SCPs in the design of neuroprosthetics.},

	learning of a novel visuomotor transformation (a 60 degrees counterclockwise
	screen-cursor rotation), which required inhibition of a prepotent
	visuomotor response. A control group experienced a familiar transformation
	and thus, did not face any executive challenge. Analysis of the experimental
	group hemodynamic responses revealed that the performance enhancement
	was associated with a monotonic reduction in the oxygenation level
	in the prefrontal cortex. This finding confirms and extends functional
	magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography studies of
	visuomotor adaptation and learning. The changes in prefrontal brain
	activation suggest an initial recruitment of frontal executive functioning
	to inhibit prepotent visuomotor mappings followed by a progressive
	de-recruitment of the same prefrontal regions. The prefrontal hemodynamic
	changes observed in the experimental group translated into enhanced
	motor performance revealed by a reduction in movement time, movement
	extent, root mean square error and the directional error. These kinematic
	adaptations are consistent with the acquisition of an internal model
	of the novel visuomotor transformation. No comparable change was
	observed in the control group for either the hemodynamics or for

  abstract = {Cerebellar damage impairs the control of complex dynamics during reaching
	movements. It also impairs learning of predictable dynamic perturbations
	through an error-based process. Prior work suggests that there are
	distinct neural mechanisms involved in error-based learning that
	depend on the size of error experienced. This is based, in part,
	on the observation that people with cerebellar degeneration may have
	an intact ability to learn from small errors. Here we studied the
	relative effect of specific dynamic perturbations and error size
	on motor learning of a reaching movement in patients with cerebellar
	damage. We also studied generalization of learning within different
	coordinate systems (hand vs. joint space). Contrary to our expectation,
	we found that error size did not alter cerebellar patients' ability
	to learn the force field. Instead, the direction of the force field
	affected patients' ability to learn, regardless of whether the force
	perturbations were introduced gradually (small error) or abruptly
	(large error). Patients performed best in fields that helped them
	compensate for movement dynamics associated with reaching. However,
	they showed much more limited generalization patterns than control
	subjects, indicating that patients rely on a different learning mechanism.
	We suggest that patients typically use a compensatory strategy to
	counteract movement dynamics. They may learn to relax this compensatory
	strategy when the external perturbation is favorable to counteracting
	their movement dynamics, and improve reaching performance. Altogether,
	these findings show that dynamics affect learning in cerebellar patients
	more than error size.},

  abstract = {In motor tasks, errors between planned and actual movements generally
	result in adaptive changes which reduce the occurrence of similar
	errors in the future. It has commonly been assumed that the motor
	adaptation arising from an error occurring on a particular movement
	is specifically associated with the motion that was planned. Here
	we show that this is not the case. Instead, we demonstrate the binding
	of the adaptation arising from an error on a particular trial to
	the motion experienced on that same trial. The formation of this
	association means that future movements planned to resemble the motion
	experienced on a given trial benefit maximally from the adaptation
	arising from it. This reflects the idea that actual rather than planned
	motions are assigned 'credit' for motor errors because, in a computational
	sense, the maximal adaptive response would be associated with the
	condition credited with the error. We studied this process by examining
	the patterns of generalization associated with motor adaptation to
	novel dynamic environments during reaching arm movements in humans.
	We found that these patterns consistently matched those predicted
	by adaptation associated with the actual rather than the planned
	motion, with maximal generalization observed where actual motions
	were clustered. We followed up these findings by showing that a novel
	training procedure designed to leverage this newfound understanding
	of the binding of learning to action, can improve adaptation rates
	by greater than 50%. Our results provide a mechanistic framework
	for understanding the effects of partial assistance and error augmentation
	during neurologic rehabilitation, and they suggest ways to optimize
	their use.},

  abstract = {The cerebellum is critical for both motor and cognitive control. Dysfunction
	of the cerebellum is a component of multiple neurological disorders.
	In recent years, interventions have been developed that aim to excite
	or inhibit the activity and function of the human cerebellum. Transcranial
	direct current stimulation of the cerebellum (ctDCS) promises to
	be a powerful tool for the modulation of cerebellar excitability.
	This technique has gained popularity in recent years as it can be
	used to investigate human cerebellar function, is easily delivered,
	is well tolerated, and has not shown serious adverse effects. Importantly,
	the ability of ctDCS to modify behavior makes it an interesting approach
	with a potential therapeutic role for neurological patients. Through
	both electrical and non-electrical effects (vascular, metabolic)
	ctDCS is thought to modify the activity of the cerebellum and alter
	the output from cerebellar nuclei. Physiological studies have shown
	a polarity-specific effect on the modulation of cerebellar-motor
	cortex connectivity, likely via cerebellar-thalamocortical pathways.
	Modeling studies that have assessed commonly used electrode montages
	have shown that the ctDCS-generated electric field reaches the human
	cerebellum with little diffusion to neighboring structures. The posterior
	and inferior parts of the cerebellum (i.e., lobules VI-VIII) seem
	particularly susceptible to modulation by ctDCS. Numerous studies
	have shown to date that ctDCS can modulate motor learning, and affect
	cognitive and emotional processes. Importantly, this intervention
	has a good safety profile; similar to when applied over cerebral
	areas. Thus, investigations have begun exploring ctDCS as a viable
	intervention for patients with neurological conditions.},

  abstract = {Recent findings suggest that human cortex is more active during steady-speed
	unperturbed locomotion than previously thought. However, techniques
	that have been used to image the brain during locomotion lack the
	temporal resolution necessary to assess intra-stride cortical dynamics.
	Our aim was to determine if electrocortical activity is coupled to
	gait cycle phase during steady-speed human walking. We used electroencephalography
	(EEG), motion capture, and a force-measuring treadmill to record
	brain and body dynamics while eight healthy young adult subjects
	walked on a treadmill. Infomax independent component analysis (ICA)
	parsed EEG signals into maximally independent component (IC) processes
	representing electrocortical sources, muscle sources, and artifacts.
	We calculated a spatially fixed equivalent current dipole for each
	IC using an inverse modeling approach, and clustered electrocortical
	sources across subjects by similarities in dipole locations and power
	spectra. We then computed spectrograms for each electrocortical source
	that were time-locked to the gait cycle. Electrocortical sources
	in the anterior cingulate, posterior parietal, and sensorimotor cortex
	exhibited significant (p<0.05) intra-stride changes in spectral power.
	During the end of stance, as the leading foot was contacting the
	ground and the trailing foot was pushing off, alpha- and beta-band
	spectral power increased in or near the left/right sensorimotor and
	dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Power increases in the left/right
	sensorimotor cortex were more pronounced for contralateral limb push-off
	(ipsilateral heel-strike) than for ipsilateral limb push-off (contralateral
	heel-strike). Intra-stride high-gamma spectral power changes were
	evident in anterior cingulate, posterior parietal, and sensorimotor
	cortex. These data confirm cortical involvement in steady-speed human
	locomotion. Future applications of these techniques could provide
	critical insight into the neural mechanisms of movement disorders
	and gait rehabilitation.},

	It is unclear, however, what the relative contributions of these

	the phenomenon of savings-faster adaptation to a given perturbation
	the second time it is experienced-but it is unclear which components

	improved gradually with further practice. Following washout, subjects
	exhibited a strong and persistent aftereffect in trials in which
	preparation time was limited. When subjects were exposed to the same
	perturbation twice in successive days, they adapted faster the second
	time. This savings effect was, however, not seen in movements generated

  abstract = {This study examines the range of gait patterns that are perceived
	as healthy and human-like with the goal of understanding how much
	asymmetry is allowable in a gait pattern before other people start
	to notice a gait impairment. Specifically, this study explores if
	certain abnormal walking patterns can be dismissed as unimpaired
	or not uncanny. Altering gait biomechanics is generally done in the
	fields of prosthetics and rehabilitation, however the perception
	of gait is often neglected. Although a certain gait can be functional,
	it may not be considered as normal by observers. On the other hand,
	an abnormally perceived gait may be more practical or necessary in
	some situations, such as limping after an injury or stroke and when
	wearing a prosthesis. This research will help to find the balance
	between the form and function of gait. Gait patterns are synthetically
	created using a passive dynamic walker (PDW) model that allows gait
	patterns to be systematically changed without the confounding influence
	from human sensorimotor feedback during walking. This standardized
	method allows the perception of specific changes in gait to be studied.
	The PDW model was used to produce walking patterns that showed a
	degree of abnormality in gait cadence, knee height, step length,
	and swing time created by changing the foot roll-over-shape, knee
	damping, knee location, and leg masses. The gait patterns were shown
	to participants who rated them according to separate scales of impairment
	and uncanniness. The results indicate that some pathological and
	asymmetric gait patterns are perceived as unimpaired and normal.
	Step time and step length asymmetries less than 5%, small knee location
	differences, and gait cadence changes of 25% do not result in a change
	in perception. The results also show that the parameters of a pathologically
	or uncanny perceived gait can be beneficially altered by increasing
	other independent parameters, in some sense masking the initial pathology.},

  abstract = {Neuroimaging studies have improved our understanding of which brain
	structures are involved in motor learning. Despite this, questions
	remain regarding the areas that contribute consistently across paradigms
	with different task demands. For instance, sensorimotor tasks focus
	on learning novel movement kinematics and dynamics, while serial
	response time task (SRTT) variants focus on sequence learning. These
	differing task demands are likely to elicit quantifiably different
	patterns of neural activity on top of a potentially consistent core
	network. The current study identified consistent activations across
	70 motor learning experiments using activation likelihood estimation
	(ALE) meta-analysis. A global analysis of all tasks revealed a bilateral
	cortical-subcortical network consistently underlying motor learning
	across tasks. Converging activations were revealed in the dorsal
	premotor cortex, supplementary motor cortex, primary motor cortex,
	primary somatosensory cortex, superior parietal lobule, thalamus,
	putamen and cerebellum. These activations were broadly consistent
	across task specific analyses that separated sensorimotor tasks and
	SRTT variants. Contrast analysis indicated that activity in the basal
	ganglia and cerebellum was significantly stronger for sensorimotor
	tasks, while activity in cortical structures and the thalamus was
	significantly stronger for SRTT variants. Additional conjunction
	analyses then indicated that the left dorsal premotor cortex was
	activated across all analyses considered, even when controlling for
	potential motor confounds. The highly consistent activation of the
	left dorsal premotor cortex suggests it is a critical node in the
	motor learning network.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: For severely paralyzed people, a brain-computer interface
	(BCI) provides a way of re-establishing communication. Although subjects
	with muscular dystrophy (MD) appear to be potential BCI users, the
	actual long-term effects of BCI use on brain activities in MD subjects
	have yet to be clarified. To investigate these effects, we followed
	BCI use by a chronic tetraplegic subject with MD over 5 months. The
	topographic changes in an electroencephalogram (EEG) after long-term
	use of the virtual reality (VR)-based BCI were also assessed. Our
	originally developed BCI system was used to classify an EEG recorded
	over the sensorimotor cortex in real time and estimate the user's
	motor intention (MI) in 3 different limb movements: feet, left hand,
	and right hand. An avatar in the internet-based VR was controlled
	in accordance with the results of the EEG classification by the BCI.
	The subject was trained to control his avatar via the BCI by strolling
	in the VR for 1 hour a day and then continued the same training twice
	a month at his home. RESULTS: After the training, the error rate
	of the EEG classification decreased from 40% to 28%. The subject
	successfully walked around in the VR using only his MI and chatted
	with other users through a voice-chat function embedded in the internet-based
	VR. With this improvement in BCI control, event-related desynchronization
	(ERD) following MI was significantly enhanced (p < 0.01) for feet
	MI (from -29% to -55%), left-hand MI (from -23% to -42%), and right-hand
	MI (from -22% to -51%). CONCLUSIONS: These results show that our
	subject with severe MD was able to learn to control his EEG signal
	and communicate with other users through use of VR navigation and
	suggest that an internet-based VR has the potential to provide paralyzed
	people with the opportunity for easy communication.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new online single-trial EEG-based brain-computer
	interface (BCI) for controlling hand holding and sequence of hand
	grasping and opening in an interactive virtual reality environment.
	The goal of this research is to develop an interaction technique
	that will allow the BCI to be effective in real-world scenarios for
	hand grasp control. One of the major challenges in the BCI research
	is the subject training. Currently, in most online BCI systems, the
	classifier was trained offline using the data obtained during the
	experiments without feedback, and used in the next sessions in which
	the subjects receive feedback. We investigated whether the subject
	could achieve satisfactory online performance without offline training
	while the subjects receive feedback from the beginning of the experiments
	during hand movement imagination. Another important issue in designing
	an online BCI system is the machine learning to classify the brain
	signal which is characterized by significant day-to-day and subject-to-subject
	variations and time-varying probability distributions. Due to these
	variabilities, we introduce the use of an adaptive probabilistic
	neural network (APNN) working in a time-varying environment for classification
	of EEG signals. The experimental evaluation on ten naive subjects
	demonstrated that an average classification accuracy of 75.4% was
	obtained during the first experiment session (day) after about 3
	min of online training without offline training, and 81.4% during
	the second session (day). The average rates during third and eighth
	sessions are 79.0% and 84.0%, respectively, using previously calculated
	classifier during the first sessions, without online training and
	without the need to calibrate. The results obtained from more than
	5000 trials on ten subjects showed that the method could provide
	a robust performance over different experiment sessions and different
	subjects.},

	There is a need to identify the best training strategies for retraining

	Before recommending VR for use in clinical practice, it is important
	to understand the evidence regarding its effectiveness. METHOD: Two
	questions about the effectiveness of VR for UL rehabilitation in
	stroke were posed: (1) Is the use of immersive VR more effective
	than conventional therapy or no therapy in the rehabilitation of
	the UL in patients with hemiplegia? (2) Is the use of nonimmersive
	VR more effective than conventional therapy or no therapy in the
	rehabilitation of the UL in patients with hemiplegia? RESULTS: There
	is level 1b evidence suggesting an advantage to training in immersive
	VR environments versus no therapy in UL rehabilitation, and level
	5 evidence for training in immersive VR versus conventional therapy.
	There is level 4 evidence showing conflicting results for training

	in nonimmersive VR versus conventional therapy. CONCLUSION: The current
	evidence on the effectiveness of using VR in the rehabilitation of
	the UL in patients with stroke is limited but sufficiently encouraging
	to justify additional clinical trials in this population.},

  abstract = {A brain-computer interface (BCI) system transforms neural activity
	into control signals for external devices in real time. A BCI user
	needs to learn to generate specific cortical activity patterns to
	control external devices effectively. We call this process BCI learning,
	and it often requires significant effort and time. Therefore, it
	is important to study this process and develop novel and efficient
	approaches to accelerate BCI learning. This article reviews major
	approaches that have been used for BCI learning, including computer-assisted
	learning, co-adaptive learning, operant conditioning, and sensory
	feedback. We focus on BCIs based on electrocorticography and intracortical
	microelectrode arrays for restoring motor function. This article
	also explores the possibility of brain modulation techniques in promoting
	BCI learning, such as electrical cortical stimulation, transcranial
	magnetic stimulation, and optogenetics. Furthermore, as proposed
	by recent BCI studies, we suggest that BCI learning is in many ways
	analogous to motor and cognitive skill learning, and therefore skill
	learning should be a useful metaphor to model BCI learning.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several neurorehabilitation strategies have been introduced
	over the last decade based on the so-called simulation hypothesis.
	This hypothesis states that a neural network located in primary and
	secondary motor areas is activated not only during overt motor execution,
	but also during observation or imagery of the same motor action.
	Based on this hypothesis, we investigated the combination of a virtual
	reality (VR) based neurorehabilitation system together with a wireless
	functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) instrument. This combination
	is particularly appealing from a rehabilitation perspective as it
	may allow minimally constrained monitoring during neurorehabilitative
	training. METHODS: fNIRS was applied over F3 of healthy subjects
	during task performance in a virtual reality (VR) environment: 1)
	'unilateral' group (N = 15), contralateral recording during observation,
	motor imagery, observation & motor imagery, and imitation of a grasping
	task performed by a virtual limb (first-person perspective view)
	using the right hand; 2) 'bilateral' group (N = 8), bilateral recording
	during observation and imitation of the same task using the right
	and left hand alternately. RESULTS: In the unilateral group, significant
	within-condition oxy-hemoglobin concentration Delta[O2Hb] changes
	(mean +/- SD mumol/l) were found for motor imagery (0.0868 +/- 0.5201
	mumol/l) and imitation (0.1715 +/- 0.4567 mumol/l). In addition,
	the bilateral group showed a significant within-condition Delta[O2Hb]
	change for observation (0.0924 +/- 0.3369 mumol/l) as well as between-conditions
	with lower Delta[O2Hb] amplitudes during observation compared to
	imitation, especially in the ipsilateral hemisphere (p < 0.001).
	Further, in the bilateral group, imitation using the non-dominant
	(left) hand resulted in larger Delta[O2Hb] changes in both the ipsi-
	and contralateral hemispheres as compared to using the dominant (right)
	hand. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that our combined VR-fNIRS based
	neurorehabilitation system can activate the action-observation system
	as described by the simulation hypothesis during performance of observation,
	motor imagery and imitation of hand actions elicited by a VR environment.
	Further, in accordance with previous studies, the findings of this
	study revealed that both inter-subject variability and handedness
	need to be taken into account when recording in untrained subjects.
	These findings are of relevance for demonstrating the potential of
	the VR-fNIRS instrument in neurofeedback applications.},

	(ERD/ERS) in electroencephalogram signals associated with motor execution/imagery
	of right/left hand movement. Comparing with traditional method using

	impairment over and above that of spontaneous biological recovery.
	Robotic neurorehabilitation has the potential for a greater impact
	on impairment due to easy deployment, its applicability across of
	a wide range of motor impairment, its high measurement reliability,
	and the capacity to deliver high dosage and high intensity training
	protocols. We first describe current knowledge of the natural history
	of arm recovery after stroke and of outcome prediction in individual
	patients. Rehabilitation strategies and outcome measures for impairment
	versus function are compared. The topics of dosage, intensity, and
	time of rehabilitation are then discussed. Robots are particularly
	suitable for both rigorous testing and application of motor learning
	principles to neurorehabilitation. Computational motor control and
	learning principles derived from studies in healthy subjects are
	introduced in the context of robotic neurorehabilitation. Particular
	attention is paid to the idea of context, task generalization and
	training schedule. The assumptions that underlie the choice of both
	movement trajectory programmed into the robot and the degree of active
	participation required by subjects are examined. We consider rehabilitation
	as a general learning problem, and examine it from the perspective
	of theoretical learning frameworks such as supervised and unsupervised
	learning. We discuss the limitations of current robotic neurorehabilitation
	paradigms and suggest new research directions from the perspective
	of computational motor learning.},

	training system for EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI). The
	proposed system can help individuals get the feel of motor imagery
	by presenting them with real-time brain activation maps on their
	cortex. Ten healthy participants took part in our experiment, half
	of whom were trained by the suggested training system and the others
	did not use any training. All participants in the trained group succeeded
	in performing motor imagery after a series of trials to activate
	their motor cortex without any physical movements of their limbs.
	To confirm the effect of the suggested system, we recorded EEG signals
	for the trained group around sensorimotor cortex while they were
	imagining either left or right hand movements according to our experimental
	design, before and after the motor imagery training. For the control
	group, we also recorded EEG signals twice without any training sessions.
	The participants' intentions were then classified using a time-frequency
	analysis technique, and the results of the trained group showed significant
	differences in the sensorimotor rhythms between the signals recorded
	before and after training. Classification accuracy was also enhanced
	considerably in all participants after motor imagery training, compared
	to the accuracy before training. On the other hand, the analysis
	results for the control EEG data set did not show consistent increment
	in both the number of meaningful time-frequency combinations and
	the classification accuracy, demonstrating that the suggested system
	can be used as a tool for training motor imagery tasks in BCI applications.
	Further, we expect that the motor imagery training system will be
	useful not only for BCI applications, but for functional brain mapping
	studies that utilize motor imagery tasks as well.},

  abstract = {Treatment of motor symptoms of degenerative cerebellar ataxia remains
	difficult. Yet there are recent developments that are likely to lead
	to significant improvements in the future. Most desirable would be
	a causative treatment of the underlying cerebellar disease. This
	is currently available only for a very small subset of cerebellar
	ataxias with known metabolic dysfunction. However, increasing knowledge
	of the pathophysiology of hereditary ataxia should lead to an increasing
	number of medically sensible drug trials. In this paper, data from
	recent drug trials in patients with recessive and dominant cerebellar
	ataxias will be summarized. There is consensus that up to date, no
	medication has been proven effective. Aminopyridines and acetazolamide
	are the only exception, which are beneficial in patients with episodic
	ataxia type 2. Aminopyridines are also effective in a subset of patients
	presenting with downbeat nystagmus. As such, all authors agreed that
	the mainstays of treatment of degenerative cerebellar ataxia are
	currently physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy.
	For many years, well-controlled rehabilitation studies in patients
	with cerebellar ataxia were lacking. Data of recently published studies
	show that coordinative training improves motor function in both adult
	and juvenile patients with cerebellar degeneration. Given the well-known
	contribution of the cerebellum to motor learning, possible mechanisms
	underlying improvement will be outlined. There is consensus that
	evidence-based guidelines for the physiotherapy of degenerative cerebellar
	ataxia need to be developed. Future developments in physiotherapeutical
	interventions will be discussed including application of non-invasive
	brain stimulation.},

	of standing posture, "virtual walking" (VW) that was observation

	The GO stimuli yielded activation of the SMA, PMd, inferior frontal

  abstract = {Adaptation is sometimes viewed as a process in which the nervous system
	learns to predict and cancel effects of a novel environment, returning
	movements to near baseline (unperturbed) conditions. An alternate
	view is that cancellation is not the goal of adaptation. Rather,
	the goal is to maximize performance in that environment. If performance
	criteria are well defined, theory allows one to predict the reoptimized
	trajectory. For example, if velocity-dependent forces perturb the
	hand perpendicular to the direction of a reaching movement, the best
	reach plan is not a straight line but a curved path that appears
	to overcompensate for the forces. If this environment is stochastic
	(changing from trial to trial), the reoptimized plan should take
	into account this uncertainty, removing the overcompensation. If
	the stochastic environment is zero-mean, peak velocities should increase
	to allow for more time to approach the target. Finally, if one is
	reaching through a via-point, the optimum plan in a zero-mean deterministic
	environment is a smooth movement but in a zero-mean stochastic environment
	is a segmented movement. We observed all of these tendencies in how
	people adapt to novel environments. Therefore, motor control in a
	novel environment is not a process of perturbation cancellation.
	Rather, the process resembles reoptimization: through practice in
	the novel environment, we learn internal models that predict sensory
	consequences of motor commands. Through reward-based optimization,
	we use the internal model to search for a better movement plan to
	minimize implicit motor costs and maximize rewards.},

  abstract = {Voluntary motor commands produce two kinds of consequences. Initially,
	a sensory consequence is observed in terms of activity in our primary
	sensory organs (e.g., vision, proprioception). Subsequently, the
	brain evaluates the sensory feedback and produces a subjective measure
	of utility or usefulness of the motor commands (e.g., reward). As
	a result, comparisons between predicted and observed consequences
	of motor commands produce two forms of prediction error. How do these
	errors contribute to changes in motor commands? Here, we considered
	a reach adaptation protocol and found that when high quality sensory
	feedback was available, adaptation of motor commands was driven almost
	exclusively by sensory prediction errors. This form of learning had
	a distinct signature: as motor commands adapted, the subjects altered
	their predictions regarding sensory consequences of motor commands,
	and generalized this learning broadly to neighboring motor commands.
	In contrast, as the quality of the sensory feedback degraded, adaptation
	of motor commands became more dependent on reward prediction errors.
	Reward prediction errors produced comparable changes in the motor
	commands, but produced no change in the predicted sensory consequences
	of motor commands, and generalized only locally. Because we found
	that there was a within subject correlation between generalization
	patterns and sensory remapping, it is plausible that during adaptation
	an individual's relative reliance on sensory vs. reward prediction
	errors could be inferred. We suggest that while motor commands change
	because of sensory and reward prediction errors, only sensory prediction
	errors produce a change in the neural system that predicts sensory
	consequences of motor commands.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) aim to provide a means
	for people with severe motor disabilities to control their environment
	directly with neural activity. In intracortical BCIs for people with
	tetraplegia, the decoder that maps neural activity to desired movements
	has typically been calibrated using 'open-loop' (OL) imagination
	of control while a cursor automatically moves to targets on a computer
	screen. However, because neural activity can vary across contexts,
	a decoder calibrated using OL data may not be optimal for 'closed-loop'
	(CL) neural control. Here, we tested whether CL calibration creates
	a better decoder than OL calibration even when all other factors
	that might influence performance are held constant, including the
	amount of data used for calibration and the amount of elapsed time
	between calibration and testing. APPROACH: Two people with tetraplegia
	enrolled in the BrainGate2 pilot clinical trial performed a center-out-back
	task using an intracortical BCI, switching between decoders that
	had been calibrated on OL versus CL data. MAIN RESULTS: Even when
	all other variables were held constant, CL calibration improved neural
	control as well as the accuracy and strength of the tuning model.
	Updating the CL decoder using additional and more recent data resulted
	in further improvements. SIGNIFICANCE: Differences in neural activity
	between OL and CL contexts contribute to the superiority of CL decoders,
	even prior to their additional 'adaptive' advantage. In the near
	future, CL decoder calibration may enable robust neural control without
	needing to pause ongoing, practical use of BCIs, an important step
	toward clinical utility.},

  abstract = {Human locomotor adaptive learning is thought to involve the cerebellum,
	but the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying this process are
	not known. While animal research has pointed to depressive modulation
	of cerebellar outputs, a direct correlation between adaptive learning
	and cerebellar depression has never been demonstrated. Here, we used
	transcranial magnetic stimulation to assess excitability changes
	occurring in the cerebellum and primary motor cortex (M1) after individuals
	learned a new locomotor pattern on a split-belt treadmill. To control
	for potential changes associated to task performance complexity,
	the same group of subjects was also assessed after performing 2 other
	locomotor tasks that did not elicit learning. We found that only
	adaptive learning resulted in reduction of cerebellar inhibition.
	This effect was strongly correlated with the magnitude of learning
	(r = 0.78). In contrast, M1 excitability changes were not specific
	to learning but rather occurred in association with task complexity
	performance. Our results demonstrate that locomotor adaptive learning
	in humans is proportional to cerebellar excitability depression.
	This finding supports the theory that adaptive learning is mediated,
	at least in part, by long-term depression in Purkinje cells. This
	knowledge opens the opportunity to target cerebellar processes with
	noninvasive brain stimulation to enhance motor learning.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Applications of brain-computer interfacing (BCI) in neurorehabilitation
	have received increasing attention. The intention to perform a motor
	task can be detected from scalp EEG and used to control rehabilitation
	devices, resulting in a patient-driven rehabilitation paradigm. In
	this study, we present and validate a BCI system for detection of
	gait initiation using movement related cortical potentials (MRCP).
	METHODS: The templates of MRCP were extracted from 9-channel scalp
	EEG during gait initiation in 9 healthy subjects. Independent component
	analysis (ICA) was used to remove artifacts, and the Laplacian spatial
	filter was applied to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of MRCP.
	Following these pre-processing steps, a matched filter was used to
	perform single-trial detection of gait initiation. RESULTS: ICA preprocessing
	was shown to significantly improve the detection performance. With
	ICA preprocessing, across all subjects, the true positive rate (TPR)
	of the detection was 76.9+/-8.97%, and the false positive rate was
	2.93+/-1.09 per minute. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate the feasibility
	of detecting the intention of gait initiation from EEG signals, on
	a single trial basis. SIGNIFICANCE: The results are important for
	the development of new gait rehabilitation strategies, either for
	recovery/replacement of function or for neuromodulation.},

	responsible for actions performed when unconscious. Recent research
	found that the generation of an action and the building of a conscious

	mechanisms for self-consciousness. Yet, previous agency studies have
	focussed on actions of a finger or hand. Here, we investigate how
	agents consciously monitor actions of the entire body in space during
	locomotion. This was motivated by previous work revealing that (1)
	a fundamental aspect of self-consciousness concerns a single and
	coherent representation of the entire spatially situated body and
	(2) clinical instances of human behaviour without consciousness occur
	in rare neurological conditions such as sleepwalking or epileptic
	nocturnal wandering. Merging techniques from virtual reality, full-body
	tracking, and cognitive science of conscious action monitoring, we
	report experimental data about consciousness during locomotion in
	healthy participants. We find that agents consciously monitor the
	location of their entire body and its locomotion only with low precision
	and report that while precision remains low it can be systematically
	modulated in several experimental conditions. This shows that conscious
	action monitoring in locomoting agents can be studied in a fine-grained
	manner. We argue that the study of the mechanisms of agency for a
	person's full body may help to refine our scientific criteria of
	self-hood and discuss sleepwalking and related conditions as alterations
	in neural systems encoding motor awareness in walking humans.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Force-sensing split-belt treadmills (TMs) provide an alternative
	to the conventional overground (OG) setting and allow new avenues
	for analyzing the biomechanics and motor control of walking. However,
	walking control may differ on a TM compared with walking OG. OBJECTIVE:
	To compare spatiotemporal, kinematic, and EMG-based measures of motor
	control between TM and OG walking at self-selected and fastest comfortable
	speeds in persons with poststroke hemiparesis. METHODS: Individuals
	with chronic hemiparesis (56) and similarly aged healthy individuals
	(17) walked over an instrumented walkway and on an instrumented split-belt
	TM; 16 channels of EMG recorded bilateral muscle activity, and a
	12-camera motion capture system collected bilateral 3D kinematics.
	The authors applied a nonnegative matrix factorization (NNMF) algorithm
	to examine the underlying patterns of motor control. RESULTS: Self-selected
	walking patterns differed on the TM versus OG in controls: speed
	decreased, stride length decreased, stance percentage increased,
	and double-support percentage increased. Poststroke, responses were
	similar, but cadence also decreased, and step length asymmetry increased.
	Kinematic patterns were similar except those associated with slower
	walking speeds. NNMF demonstrated similar EMG variance in the 2 environments.
	CONCLUSION: Persons, both healthy and poststroke, walk with different
	gait parameters on the TM. Although measures of motor control were
	mostly similar between the 2 environments, the TM induced step length
	asymmetry in 30% of participants (60% of whom took longer paretic
	steps). TM walking, therefore, is a valid method for detecting motor
	control deficits.},

  abstract = {Neural prosthetic interfaces use neural activity related to the planning
	and perimovement epochs of arm reaching to afford brain-directed
	control of external devices. Previous research has primarily centered
	on accurately decoding movement intention from either plan or perimovement
	activity, but has assumed that temporal boundaries between these
	epochs are known to the decoding system. In this work, we develop
	a technique to automatically differentiate between baseline, plan,
	and perimovement epochs of neural activity. Specifically, we use
	a generative model of neural activity to capture how neural activity
	varies between these three epochs. Our approach is based on a hidden
	Markov model (HMM), in which the latent variable (state) corresponds
	to the epoch of neural activity, coupled with a state-dependent Poisson
	firing model. Using an HMM, we demonstrate that the time of transition
	from baseline to plan epochs, a transition in neural activity that
	is not accompanied by any external behavior changes, can be detected
	using a threshold on the a posteriori HMM state probabilities. Following
	detection of the plan epoch, we show that the intended target of
	a center-out movement can be detected about as accurately as that
	by a maximum-likelihood estimator using a window of known plan activity.
	In addition, we demonstrate that our HMM can detect transitions in
	neural activity corresponding to targets not found in training data.
	Thus the HMM technique for automatically detecting transitions between
	epochs of neural activity enables prosthetic interfaces that can
	operate autonomously.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Non-invasive measurement of human neural activity based
	on the scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) allows for the development
	of biomedical devices that interface with the nervous system for
	scientific, diagnostic, therapeutic, or restorative purposes. However,
	EEG recordings are often considered as prone to physiological and
	non-physiological artifacts of different types and frequency characteristics.
	Among them, ocular artifacts and signal drifts represent major sources
	of EEG contamination, particularly in real-time closed-loop brain-machine
	interface (BMI) applications, which require effective handling of
	these artifacts across sessions and in natural settings. APPROACH:
	We extend the usage of a robust adaptive noise cancelling (ANC) scheme
	([Formula: see text] filtering) for removal of eye blinks, eye motions,
	amplitude drifts and recording biases simultaneously. We also characterize
	the volume conduction, by estimating the signal propagation levels
	across all EEG scalp recording areas due to ocular artifact generators.
	We find that the amplitude and spatial distribution of ocular artifacts
	vary greatly depending on the electrode location. Therefore, fixed
	filtering parameters for all recording areas would naturally hinder
	the true overall performance of an ANC scheme for artifact removal.
	We treat each electrode as a separate sub-system to be filtered,
	and without the loss of generality, they are assumed to be uncorrelated
	and uncoupled. MAIN RESULTS: Our results show over 95-99.9% correlation
	between the raw and processed signals at non-ocular artifact regions,
	and depending on the contamination profile, 40-70% correlation when
	ocular artifacts are dominant. We also compare our results with the
	offline independent component analysis and artifact subspace reconstruction
	methods, and show that some local quantities are handled better by
	our sample-adaptive real-time framework. Decoding performance is
	also compared with multi-day experimental data from 2 subjects, totaling
	19 sessions, with and without [Formula: see text] filtering of the
	raw data. SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed method allows real-time adaptive
	artifact removal for EEG-based closed-loop BMI applications and mobile
	EEG studies in general, thereby increasing the range of tasks that
	can be studied in action and context while reducing the need for
	discarding data due to artifacts. Significant increase in decoding
	performances also justify the effectiveness of the method to be used
	in real-time closed-loop BMI applications.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Spinal cord injury (SCI) can leave the affected individuals
	with paraparesis or paraplegia, thus rendering them unable to ambulate.
	Since there are currently no restorative treatments for this population,
	novel approaches such as brain-controlled prostheses have been sought.
	Our recent studies show that a brain-computer interface (BCI) can
	be used to control ambulation within a virtual reality environment
	(VRE), suggesting that a BCI-controlled lower extremity prosthesis
	for ambulation may be feasible. However, the operability of our BCI
	has not yet been tested in a SCI population. METHODS:Five participants
	with paraplegia or tetraplegia due to SCI underwent a 10-min training
	session in which they alternated between kinesthetic motor imagery
	(KMI) of idling and walking while their electroencephalogram (EEG)
	were recorded. Participants then performed a goal-oriented online
	task, where they utilized KMI to control the linear ambulation of
	an avatar while making 10 sequential stops at designated points within
	the VRE. Multiple online trials were performed in a single day, and
	this procedure was repeated across 5 experimental days. RESULTS:Classification
	accuracy of idling and walking was estimated offline and ranged from
	60.5% (pâ€‰=â€‰0.0176) to 92.3% (pâ€‰=â€‰1.36Ã—10-20) across participants
	and days. Offline analysis revealed that the activation of mid-frontal
	areas mostly in the Î¼ and low Î² bands was the most consistent feature
	for differentiating between idling and walking KMI. In the online
	task, participants achieved an average performance of 7.4Â±2.3 successful
	stops in 273Â±51 sec. These performances were purposeful, i.e. significantly
	different from the random walk Monte Carlo simulations (p<0.01),
	and all but one participant achieved purposeful control within the
	first day of the experiments. Finally, all participants were able
	to maintain purposeful control throughout the study, and their online
	performances improved over time. CONCLUSIONS:The results of this
	study demonstrate that SCI participants can purposefully operate
	a self-paced BCI walking simulator to complete a goal-oriented ambulation
	task. The operation of the proposed BCI system requires short training,
	is intuitive, and robust against participant-to-participant and day-to-day
	neurophysiological variations. These findings indicate that BCI-controlled
	lower extremity prostheses for gait rehabilitation or restoration
	after SCI may be feasible in the future.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: High-density electroencephelography (EEG) can provide an
	insight into human brain function during real-world activities with
	walking. Some recent studies have used EEG to characterize brain
	activity during walking, but the relative contributions of movement
	artifact and electrocortical activity have been difficult to quantify.
	We aimed to characterize movement artifact recorded by EEG electrodes
	at a range of walking speeds and to test the efficacy of artifact
	removal methods. We also quantified the similarity between movement
	artifact recorded by EEG electrodes and a head-mounted accelerometer.
	APPROACH: We used a novel experimental method to isolate and record
	movement artifact with EEG electrodes during walking. We blocked
	electrophysiological signals using a nonconductive layer (silicone
	swim cap) and simulated an electrically conductive scalp on top of
	the swim cap using a wig coated with conductive gel. We recorded
	motion artifact EEG data from nine young human subjects walking on
	a treadmill at speeds from 0.4 to 1.6 m s(-1). We then tested artifact
	removal methods including moving average and wavelet-based techniques.
	MAIN RESULTS: Movement artifact recorded with EEG electrodes varied
	considerably, across speed, subject, and electrode location. The
	movement artifact measured with EEG electrodes did not correlate
	well with head acceleration. All of the tested artifact removal methods
	attenuated low-frequency noise but did not completely remove movement
	artifact. The spectral power fluctuations in the movement artifact
	data resembled data from some previously published studies of EEG
	during walking. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that EEG data recorded
	during walking likely contains substantial movement artifact that:
	cannot be explained by head accelerations; varies across speed, subject,
	and channel; and cannot be removed using traditional signal processing
	methods. Future studies should focus on more sophisticated methods
	for removal of EEG movement artifact to advance the field.},

  abstract = {When humans walk in everyday life, they typically perform a range
	of cognitive tasks while they are on the move. Past studies examining
	performance changes in dual cognitive-motor tasks during walking
	have produced a variety of results. These discrepancies may be related
	to the type of cognitive task chosen, differences in the walking
	speeds studied, or lack of controlling for walking speed. The goal
	of this study was to determine how young, healthy subjects performed
	a spatial working memory task over a range of walking speeds. We
	used high-density electroencephalography to determine if electrocortical
	activity mirrored changes in cognitive performance across speeds.
	Subjects stood (0.0 m/s) and walked (0.4, 0.8, 1.2, and 1.6 m/s)
	with and without performing a Brooks spatial working memory task.
	We hypothesized that performance of the spatial working memory task
	and the associated electrocortical activity would decrease significantly
	with walking speed. Across speeds, the spatial working memory task
	caused subjects to step more widely compared with walking without
	the task. This is typically a sign that humans are adapting their
	gait dynamics to increase gait stability. Several cortical areas
	exhibited power fluctuations time-locked to memory encoding during
	the cognitive task. In the somatosensory association cortex, alpha
	power increased prior to stimulus presentation and decreased during
	memory encoding. There were small significant reductions in theta
	power in the right superior parietal lobule and the posterior cingulate
	cortex around memory encoding. However, the subjects did not show
	a significant change in cognitive task performance or electrocortical
	activity with walking speed. These findings indicate that in young,
	healthy subjects walking speed does not affect performance of a spatial
	working memory task. These subjects can devote adequate cortical
	resources to spatial cognition when needed, regardless of walking
	speed.},

  abstract = {The paradigm task A-->task B-->task A, which varies the time interval

	the consolidation of motor memory. Consolidation is defined as resistance
	to retrograde interference (interference by task B on initial learning
	of task A). Consolidation has been demonstrated for simple skills,
	motor sequencing, and learning of force fields. In contrast, evidence
	to date suggests that visuomotor learning does not consolidate. We
	have shown previously that adaptation to a 30 degrees screen-cursor
	rotation is faster and more complete on relearning 24 hr later. This
	improvement is prevented if a 30 degrees counter-rotation is learned
	5 min after the original rotation. Here, we sought to identify conditions
	under which rotation learning becomes resistant to interference by
	a counter-rotation. In experiment 1, we found that interference persists
	even when the counter-rotation is learned 24 hr after the initial
	rotation. In experiment 2, we removed potential anterograde interference
	(interference by task B on relearning of task A) by introducing washout
	blocks before all of the learning blocks. In contrast to experiment
	1, we found resistance to interference (i.e., consolidation) when
	the counter-rotation was learned after 24 hr but not after 5 min.
	In experiment 3, we doubled the amount of initial rotation learning
	and found resistance to interference even after 5 min. Our results
	suggest that persistent interference is attributable to anterograde
	effects on memory retrieval. When anterograde effects are removed,

  abstract = {Recent studies of upper limb movements have provided insights into
	the computations, mechanisms, and taxonomy of human sensorimotor
	learning. Motor tasks differ with respect to how they weight different
	learning processes. These include adaptation, an internal-model based
	process that reduces sensory-prediction errors in order to return
	performance to pre-perturbation levels, use-dependent plasticity,
	and operant reinforcement. Visuomotor rotation and force-field tasks
	impose systematic errors and thereby emphasize adaptation. In skill
	learning tasks, which for the most part do not involve a perturbation,
	improved performance is manifest as reduced motor variability and
	probably depends less on adaptation and more on success-based exploration.
	Explicit awareness and declarative memory contribute, to varying
	degrees, to motor learning. The modularity of motor learning processes
	maps, at least to some extent, onto distinct brain structures.},

	associated with reduced cortical activity and changes in oscillatory
	brain activity. Little is known about whether learning also affects
	the neural network associated with motor preparation and post movement
	processes. Here we investigate how short-term motor learning affects
	oscillatory brain activity during the preparation, execution, and
	post-movement stage of a forceâ€“feedback task. Methods Participants
	performed a visually guided power-grip tracking task. EEG was recorded
	from 64 scalp electrodes. Power and coherence data for the early
	and late stages of the task were compared. Results Performance improved
	with practice. During the preparation for the task alpha power was
	reduced for late experimental blocks. A movement execution-related
	decrease in beta power was attenuated with increasing task practice.
	A post-movement increase in alpha and lower beta activity was observed
	that decreased with learning. Coherence analysis revealed changes
	in cortico-cortical coupling with regard to the stage of the visuomotor
	task and with regard to learning. Learning was variably associated
	with increased coherence between contralateral and/or ipsilateral
	frontal and parietal, fronto-central, and occipital brain regions.
	Conclusions Practice of a visuomotor power-grip task is associated
	with various changes in the activity of a widespread cortical network.
	These changes might promote visuomotor learning. Significance This

	is that the deployment and calibration of the system are costly and
	labor-intensive. Some prior studies proposed the use of Pedestrian
	Dead Reckoning (PDR) for indoor localization, which does not require
	the deployment of beacon nodes. In a PDR system, a small number of

	in accurately estimating the user's moving distance and direction.
	In this work, we propose a novel waist-mounted based PDR that can
	measure the user's step lengths with a high accuracy. We utilize
	vertical acceleration of the body to calculate the user's change
	in height during walking. Based on the Pythagorean Theorem, we can
	then estimate each step length using this data. Furthermore, we design
	a map matching algorithm to calibrate the direction errors from the

	walking distance, with an overall location error of about 0.48 m.},

	of crucial importance for the study of large-scale interactions in

	on two distinct approaches which permit a direct estimation of the
	instantaneous phase of a signal [Phys. Rev. Lett. 81 (1998) 3291;
	Human Brain Mapping 8 (1999) 194]. The phase is either estimated
	by using the analytic concept of Hilbert transform or, alternatively,
	by convolution with a complex wavelet. In both methods the stability
	of the instantaneous phase over a window of time requires quantification
	by means of various statistical dependence parameters (standard deviation,
	Shannon entropy or mutual information). The purpose of this paper
	is to conduct a direct comparison between these two methods on three
	signal sets: (1) neural models; (2) intracranial signals from epileptic
	patients; and (3) scalp EEG recordings. Levels of synchrony that
	can be considered as reliable are estimated by using the technique
	of surrogate data. Our results demonstrate that the differences between
	the methods are minor, and we conclude that they are fundamentally
	equivalent for the study of neuroelectrical signals. This offers

  year     = {2014},
  volume   = {11},
  pages    = {9},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) can potentially be used
	to aid in the recovery of lost motor control in a limb following
	stroke. BCIs are typically used by subjects with no damage to the
	brain therefore relatively little is known about the technical requirements
	for the design of a rehabilitative BCI for stroke. METHODS:32-channel
	electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded during a finger-tapping task
	from 10 healthy subjects for one session and 5 stroke patients for
	two sessions approximately 6 months apart. An off-line BCI design
	based on Filter Bank Common Spatial Patterns (FBCSP) was implemented
	to test and compare the efficacy and accuracy of training a rehabilitative
	BCI with both stroke-affected and healthy data. RESULTS:Stroke-affected
	EEG datasets have lower 10-fold cross validation results than healthy
	EEG datasets. When training a BCI with healthy EEG, average classification
	accuracy of stroke-affected EEG is lower than the average for healthy
	EEG. Classification accuracy of the late session stroke EEG is improved
	by training the BCI on the corresponding early stroke EEG dataset.
	CONCLUSIONS:This exploratory study illustrates that stroke and the
	accompanying neuroplastic changes associated with the recovery process
	can cause significant inter-subject changes in the EEG features suitable
	for mapping as part of a neurofeedback therapy, even when individuals
	have scored largely similar with conventional behavioural measures.

	walking conditions were made for temporal gait parameters such as
	step length and cadence, leg kinematics, joint moments and powers,
	and muscle activity. Overall, very few differences were found in
	temporal gait parameters or leg kinematics between treadmill and
	overground walking. Conversely, sagittal plane joint moments were
	found to be quite different, where during treadmill walking trials,
	subjects demonstrated less dorsiflexor moments, less knee extensor
	moments, and greater hip extensor moments. Joint powers in the sagittal
	plane were found to be similar at the ankle but quite different at
	the knee and hip joints. Differences in muscle activity were observed
	between the two walking modalities, particularly in the tibialis
	anterior throughout stance, and in the hamstrings, vastus medialis
	and adductor longus during swing. While differences were observed
	in muscle activation patterns, joint moments and joint powers between
	the two walking modalities, the overall patterns in these behaviors
	were quite similar. From a therapeutic perspective, this suggests

  abstract = {Early detection of movement intention could possibly minimize the

	trial analysis using non-invasive approaches for understanding such
	movement preparation remains a challenging task. We studied the feasibility
	of predicting movement directions in self-paced upper limb center-out
	reaching tasks, i.e., spontaneous movements executed without an external
	cue that can better reflect natural motor behavior in humans. We
	reported results of non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) recorded
	from mild stroke patients and able-bodied participants. Previous
	studies have shown that low frequency EEG oscillations are modulated
	by the intent to move and therefore, can be decoded prior to the
	movement execution. Motivated by these results, we investigated whether
	slow cortical potentials (SCPs) preceding movement onset can be used
	to classify reaching directions and evaluated the performance using
	5-fold cross-validation. For able-bodied subjects, we obtained an
	average decoding accuracy of 76% (chance level of 25%) at 62.5 ms
	before onset using the amplitude of on-going SCPs with above chance
	level performances between 875 to 437.5 ms prior to onset. The decoding
	accuracy for the stroke patients was on average 47% with their paretic
	arms. Comparison of the decoding accuracy across different frequency
	ranges (i.e., SCPs, delta, theta, alpha, and gamma) yielded the best
	accuracy using SCPs filtered between 0.1 to 1 Hz. Across all the
	subjects, including stroke subjects, the best selected features were
	obtained mostly from the fronto-parietal regions, hence consistent
	with previous neurophysiological studies on arm reaching tasks. In
	summary, we concluded that SCPs allow the possibility of single trial
	decoding of reaching directions at least 312.5 ms before onset of
	reach.},

	legs. A portable terrain recognition (TR) module, consisting of an
	inertia measurement unit and a laser distance meter, was built to
	identify the type of terrain in front of the wearer while walking.
	A decision tree was used to classify the terrain types and provide
	either coarse or refined information about the walking environment.
	Then, the obtained environmental information was modeled as a priori
	probability and was integrated with a neuromuscular-mechanical-fusion-based
	locomotion mode (LM) recognition system. The designed TR module and
	environmental-aware LM recognition system was evaluated separately
	on able-bodied subjects and a transfemoral amputee online. The results
	showed that the TR module provided high quality environmental information:
	TR accuracy is above 98% and terrain transitions are detected over
	500 ms before the time required to switch the prosthesis control
	mode. This enabled smooth locomotion mode transitions for the wearers.

	DESIGN:Randomized controlled trial. SETTING:Outpatient neurorehabilitation
	unit. PARTICIPANTS:A total of 20 individuals with chronic stroke.
	INTERVENTIONS:The intervention consisted of 20 one-hour sessions,
	five sessions per week. The experimental group combined 30â€‰minutes
	with the virtual reality-based intervention with 30â€‰minutes of
	conventional training. The control group underwent one hour conventional
	therapy. MAIN MEASURES:Balance performance was assessed at the beginning
	and at the end of the trial using the Berg Balance Scale, the balance
	and gait subscales of the Tinetti Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment,
	the Brunel Balance Assessment, and the 10-m Walking Test. Subjective
	data of the virtual reality-based intervention were collected from
	the experimental group, with a feedback questionnaire at the end
	of the trial. RESULTS:The results revealed a significant group-by-time
	interaction in the scores of the Berg Balance Scale (p < 0.05) and
	in the 10-m Walking Test (p < 0.05). Post-hoc analyses showed greater
	improvement in the experimental group: 3.8 Â±2.6 vs. 1.8 Â±1.4 in
	the Berg Balance Scale, -1.9 Â±1.6â€‰seconds vs. 0.0 Â±2.3â€‰seconds
	in the 10-m Walking Test, and also in the number of participants
	who increased level in the Brunel Balance Assessment (Ï‡(2) = 2.5,
	p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS:Virtual reality interventions can be an effective
	resource to enhance the improvement of balance in individuals with
	chronic stroke.},

  abstract = {Therapist-assisted body weight supported (TABWS) gait rehabilitation
	was introduced two decades ago. The benefit of TABWS in functional
	recovery of walking in spinal cord injury and stroke patients has
	been demonstrated and reported. However, shortage of therapists,
	labor-intensiveness, and short duration of training are some limitations
	of this approach. To overcome these deficiencies, robotic-assisted
	gait rehabilitation systems have been suggested. These systems have
	gained attentions from researchers and clinical practitioner in recent
	years. To achieve the same objective, an over-ground gait rehabilitation
	system, NaTUre-gaits, was developed at the Nanyang Technological
	University. The design was based on a clinical approach to provide
	four main features, which are pelvic motion, body weight support,
	over-ground walking experience, and lower limb assistance. These
	features can be achieved by three main modules of NaTUre-gaits: 1)
	pelvic assistance mechanism, mobile platform, and robotic orthosis.
	Predefined gait patterns are required for a robotic assisted system
	to follow. In this paper, the gait pattern planning for NaTUre-gaits
	was accomplished by an individual-specific gait pattern prediction
	model. The model generates gait patterns that resemble natural gait
	patterns of the targeted subjects. The features of NaTUre-gaits have
	been demonstrated by walking trials with several subjects. The trials
	have been evaluated by therapists and doctors. The results show that
	10-m walking trial with a reduction in manpower. The task-specific
	repetitive training approach and natural walking gait patterns were
	also successfully achieved.},

	planning is important to ensure that the gait patterns induced by

	one walking speed as per the published data. The objective of this

	neural networks (GRNNs) were designed to predict Fourier coefficient
	vectors from given gait parameters and lower limb anthropometric

	vectors were compared to the actual waveforms and CGA waveforms by
	using the assessment parameters of correlation coefficients, mean

	the main bottom-up source, and long-range top-down projections from

	change in RSC inputs. Learning also reduced the activity of somatostatin-expressing
	inhibitory neurons (SOM-INs) in V1 that could potentially gate top-down
	inputs. Finally, RSC inactivation or SOM-IN activation was sufficient

  abstract = {Control of the human walking pattern normally requires little thought,
	with conscious control used only in the face of a challenging environment
	or a perturbation. We have previously shown that people can adapt
	spatial and temporal aspects of walking to a sustained perturbation
	generated by a split-belt treadmill. Here we tested whether conscious
	correction of walking, versus distraction from it, modifies adaptation.
	Conscious correction of stepping may expedite the adaptive process
	and help to form a new walking pattern. However, because walking
	is normally an automatic process, it is possible that conscious effort
	could interfere with adaptation, whereas distraction might improve
	it by removing competing voluntary control. Three groups of subjects
	were studied: a control group was given no specific instructions,
	a conscious correction group was instructed how to step and given
	intermittent visual feedback of stepping during adaptation, and a
	distraction group performed a dual-task during adaptation. After
	adaptation, retention of aftereffects was assessed in all groups
	during normal treadmill walking without conscious effort, feedback,
	or distraction. We found that conscious correction speeds adaptation,
	whereas distraction slows it. Subjects trained with distraction retained
	aftereffects longest, suggesting that the training used during adaptation
	predicts the time course of deadaptation. An unexpected finding was
	that these manipulations affected the adaptation rate of spatial
	but not temporal elements of walking. Thus conscious processes can
	preferentially access the spatial walking pattern. It may be that
	spatial and temporal controls of locomotion are accessible through
	distinct neural circuits, with the former being most sensitive to
	conscious effort or distraction.},

  abstract = {Adaptation is an error-driven motor learning process that can account
	for predictable changes in the environment (e.g., walking on ice)
	or in ourselves (e.g., injury). Our ability to recall and build upon
	adapted motor patterns across days is essential to this learning
	process. We investigated how different training paradigms affect
	the day-to-day memory of an adapted walking pattern. Healthy human
	adults walked on a split-belt treadmill, and returned the following
	day to assess recall, relearning rate, and performance. In the first
	experiment, one group adapted and de-adapted (i.e., washed-out the
	learning) several times on day 1 to practice the initial stage of
	learning where errors are large; another group adapted only one time
	and then practiced in the adapted ("learned") state where errors
	were small. On day 2, they performed washout trials before readapting.
	The group that repeatedly practiced the initial portion of adaptation
	where errors are large showed the fastest relearning on the second
	day. In fact, the memory was nearly as strong as that of a third
	group that was left overnight in the adapted state and was not washed-out
	before reexposure on the second day. This demonstrates that alternating
	exposures to early adaptation and washout can enhance readaptation.
	In the second experiment, we tested whether the opposite split-belt
	pattern interferes with day 2 relearning. Surprisingly, it did not,
	and instead was similar to practicing in the adapted state. These
	results show that the structure of the initial phase of learning
	influences the ease of motor relearning.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the authors have proposed lightweight exoskeleton
	designs for upper arm rehabilitation using multi-stage cable-driven
	parallel mechanism. Previously, the authors have demonstrated via
	experiments that it is possible to apply "assist-as-needed" forces
	in all directions at the end-effector with such an exoskeleton acting
	on an anthropomorphic machine arm. A human-exoskeleton interface
	was also presented to show the feasibility of CAREX on human subjects.
	The goals of this paper are to 1) further address issues when CAREX
	is mounted on human subjects, e.g., generation of continuous cable
	tension trajectories 2) demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness
	of CAREX on movement training of healthy human subjects and a stroke
	patient. In this research, CAREX is rigidly attached to an arm orthosis
	worn by human subjects. The cable routing points are optimized to
	achieve a relatively large "tensioned" static workspace. A new cable
	tension planner based on quadratic programming is used to generate
	continuous cable tension trajectory for smooth motion. Experiments
	were carried out on eight healthy subjects. The experimental results
	show that CAREX can help the subjects move closer to a prescribed
	circular path using the force fields generated by the exoskeleton.
	The subjects also adapt to the path shortly after training. CAREX
	was also evaluated on a stroke patient to test the feasibility of
	its use on patients with neural impairment. The results show that
	the patient was able to move closer to a prescribed straight line
	path with the "assist-as-needed" force field.},

	missing the target to that side. Within 10â€“30 throws, they gradually

	after removal of the prisms the wide gaze-throw angle persisted and
	throws missed the target to the opposite side, the so-called â€˜negative

	both to the body parts trained and the type of throw trained: training
	with the right hand did not generalize to throwing with the left;
	overhand training seldom generalized to underhand throwing. In a
	study of long-term adjustment, two subjects threw with the same hand
	(right) and the same type of throw (overhand) alternately, with and

  abstract = {In the decomposition of multi-channel EEG signals, principal component
	analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA) have widely
	been used. However, as both methods are based on handling two-way
	data, i.e. two-dimensional matrices, multi-way methods might improve
	the interpretation of frequency transformed multi-channel EEG of
	channel x frequency x time data. The multi-way decomposition method
	Parallel Factor (PARAFAC), also named Canonical Decomposition (CANDECOMP),
	was recently used to decompose the wavelet transformed ongoing EEG
	of channel x frequency x time (Miwakeichi, F., Martinez-Montes, E.,
	Valdes-Sosa, P.A., Nishiyama, N., Mizuhara, H., Yamaguchi, Y., 2004.
	Decomposing EEG data into space-time-frequency components using parallel
	factor analysis. Neuroimage 22, 1035-1045). In this article, PARAFAC
	is used for the first time to decompose wavelet transformed event-related
	EEG given by the inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) encompassing
	ANOVA analysis of differences between conditions and 5-way analysis
	of channel x frequency x time x subject x condition. A flow chart
	is presented on how to perform data exploration using the PARAFAC
	decomposition on multi-way arrays. This includes (A) channel x frequency
	x time 3-way arrays of F test values from a repeated measures analysis
	of variance (ANOVA) between two stimulus conditions; (B) subject-specific
	3-way analyses; and (C) an overall 5-way analysis of channel x frequency
	x time x subject x condition. The PARAFAC decompositions were able
	to extract the expected features of a previously reported ERP paradigm:
	namely, a quantitative difference of coherent occipital gamma activity
	between conditions of a visual paradigm. Furthermore, the method
	revealed a qualitative difference which has not previously been reported.
	The PARAFAC decomposition of the 3-way array of ANOVA F test values
	clearly showed the difference of regions of interest across modalities,
	while the 5-way analysis enabled visualization of both quantitative
	and qualitative differences. Consequently, PARAFAC is a promising
	data exploratory tool in the analysis of the wavelets transformed
	event-related EEG.},

  abstract = {The aim of this work is to present the development of a hybrid Brain-Computer
	Interface (hBCI) which combines existing input devices with a BCI.
	Thereby, the BCI should be available if the user wishes to extend
	the types of inputs available to an assistive technology system,
	but the user can also choose not to use the BCI at all; the BCI is
	active in the background. The hBCI might decide on the one hand which
	input channel(s) offer the most reliable signal(s) and switch between
	input channels to improve information transfer rate, usability, or
	other factors, or on the other hand fuse various input channels.
	One major goal therefore is to bring the BCI technology to a level
	where it can be used in a maximum number of scenarios in a simple
	way. To achieve this, it is of great importance that the hBCI is
	able to operate reliably for long periods, recognizing and adapting
	to changes as it does so. This goal is only possible if many different
	subsystems in the hBCI can work together. Since one research institute
	alone cannot provide such different functionality, collaboration
	between institutes is necessary. To allow for such a collaboration,
	a new concept and common software framework is introduced. It consists
	of four interfaces connecting the classical BCI modules: signal acquisition,
	preprocessing, feature extraction, classification, and the application.
	But it provides also the concept of fusion and shared control. In
	a proof of concept, the functionality of the proposed system was
	demonstrated.},

	speeds (split belt) for 8-10 min, followed again by tied-belt walking
	(postsplit). Initial asymmetries in temporal coordination (i.e.,
	double support time) induced by split-belt walking were slowly reduced,
	with most children showing an aftereffect (i.e., asymmetry in the
	opposite direction to the initial) in the early postsplit period,
	indicative of learning. In contrast, asymmetries in spatial coordination
	(i.e., center of oscillation) persisted during split-belt walking
	and no aftereffect was seen. Step length, a measure of both spatial
	and temporal coordination, showed intermediate effects. The time
	course of learning in double support and step length was slower in
	children than in adults. Moreover, there was a significant negative
	correlation between the size of the initial asymmetry during early
	split-belt walking (called error) and the aftereffect for step length.
	Hence, children may have more difficulty learning when the errors
	are large. The findings further suggest that the mechanisms controlling

	The authors review present research that addresses the nature of

	motor actions, possibly by optimizing certain cost functions. In
	contrast, right hemisphere circuits appear to be important for updating
	ongoing actions and stopping at a goal position, through modulation
	of sensorimotor stabilization mechanisms such as reflexes. The authors
	also propose that each brain hemisphere contributes its mechanism
	to the control of both arms. They also discuss the potential advantages

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the impact of a continuously presented
	visual feedback in the form of a grasping hand on the modulation
	of sensorimotor EEG rhythms during online control of a brain-computer
	interface (BCI). METHODS: Two groups of participants were trained
	to use left or right hand motor imagery to control a specific output
	signal on a computer monitor: the experimental group controlled a
	moving hand performing an object-related grasp ('realistic feedback'),
	whereas the control group controlled a moving bar ('abstract feedback').
	Continuous feedback was realized by using the outcome of a real-time
	classifier which was based on EEG signals recorded from left and
	right central sites. RESULTS: The classification results show no
	difference between the two feedback groups. For both groups, ERD/ERS
	analysis revealed a significant larger ERD during feedback presentation
	compared to an initial motor imagery screening session without feedback.
	Increased ERD during online BCI control was particularly found for
	the lower alpha (8-10 Hz) and for the beta bands (16-20, 20-24 Hz).
	CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that visual BCI feedback
	clearly modulates sensorimotor EEG rhythms. When the feedback provides
	equivalent information on both the continuous and final outcomes
	of mental actions, the presentation form (abstract versus realistic)

  abstract = {Electroencephalogram (EEG) data are typically contaminated with artifacts
	(e.g., by eye movements). The effect of artifacts can be attenuated
	by deleting data with amplitudes over a certain value, for example.
	Independent component analysis (ICA) separates EEG data into neural
	activity and artifact; once identified, artifactual components can
	be deleted from the data. Often, artifact rejection algorithms require
	supervision (e.g., training using canonical artifacts). Many artifact
	rejection methods are time consuming when applied to high-density
	EEG data. We describe FASTER (Fully Automated Statistical Thresholding
	for EEG artifact Rejection). Parameters were estimated for various
	aspects of data (e.g., channel variance) in both the EEG time series
	and in the independent components of the EEG: outliers were detected
	and removed. FASTER was tested on both simulated EEG (n=47) and real
	EEG (n=47) data on 128-, 64-, and 32-scalp electrode arrays. FASTER
	was compared to supervised artifact detection by experts and to a
	variant of the Statistical Control for Dense Arrays of Sensors (SCADS)
	method. FASTER had >90% sensitivity and specificity for detection
	of contaminated channels, eye movement and EMG artifacts, linear
	trends and white noise. FASTER generally had >60% sensitivity and
	specificity for detection of contaminated epochs, vs. 0.15% for SCADS.
	FASTER also aggregates the ERP across subject datasets, and detects
	outlier datasets. The variance in the ERP baseline, a measure of
	noise, was significantly lower for FASTER than either the supervised
	or SCADS methods. ERP amplitude did not differ significantly between
	FASTER and the supervised approach.},

  abstract = {The past 20 years have represented an important period in the development
	of principles underlying neuroplasticity, especially as they apply
	to recovery from neurological injury. It is now generally accepted
	that acquired brain injuries, such as occur in stroke or trauma,
	initiate a cascade of regenerative events that last for at least
	several weeks, if not months. Many investigators have pointed out
	striking parallels between post-injury plasticity and the molecular
	and cellular events that take place during normal brain development.
	As evidence for the principles and mechanisms underlying post-injury
	neuroplasticity has been gleaned from both animal models and human
	populations, novel approaches to therapeutic intervention have been
	proposed. One important theme has persisted as the sophistication
	of clinicians and scientists in their knowledge of neuroplasticity
	mechanisms has grown: behavioral experience is the most potent modulator
	of brain plasticity. While there is substantial evidence for this
	principle in normal, healthy brains, the injured brain is particularly
	malleable. Based on the quantity and quality of motor experience,
	the brain can be reshaped after injury in either adaptive or maladaptive
	ways. This paper reviews selected studies that have demonstrated
	the neurophysiological and neuroanatomical changes that are triggered
	by motor experience, by injury, and the interaction of these processes.
	In addition, recent studies using new and elegant techniques are
	providing novel perspectives on the events that take place in the
	injured brain, providing a real-time window into post-injury plasticity.
	These new approaches are likely to accelerate the pace of basic research,
	and provide a wealth of opportunities to translate basic principles
	into therapeutic methodologies.},

	learning mechanisms by exposure to visual feedback that elicits scalp
	electroencephalogram. We examined the effect of realistic visual
	feedback of hand movement associated with sensorimotor rhythm. METHODS:
	Thirty-two healthy participants performed in five daily training
	in which they were shown motor imagery of their dominant hand. Participants
	were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 experimental groups receiving different
	types of visual feedback on event-related desynchronisation (ERD)
	derived over the contralateral sensorimotor cortex: no feedback as
	a control, bar feedback with changing bar length, anatomically incongruent
	feedback in which the hand open/grasp picture on screen was animated
	at eye level, and anatomically congruent feedback in which the same
	hand open/grasp picture was animated on the screen overlaying the
	participant's hand. RESULTS: Daily training with all types of visual
	feedback induced more robust ERD than the no feedback condition (p
	< 0.05). The anatomically congruent feedback produced the highest
	reproducibility of ERD with the smallest inter-trial variance (p
	< 0.05). CONCLUSION: Realistic feedback training is a suitable method
	to acquire the skill to control a BCI system. SIGNIFICANCE: This
	finding highlights the possibility of improvement of reproducibility
	of ERD and can help to use BCI techniques.},

	the use of decoder adaptation to shape neuroplasticity in two scenarios

	of neural activity and changes in control context. Nonhuman primates
	learned to control a cursor to perform a reaching task using semistationary
	neural activity in two contexts: with and without simultaneous arm
	movements. Decoder adaptation was used to improve initial performance
	and compensate for changes in neural recordings. We show that beneficial
	neuroplasticity can occur alongside decoder adaptation, yielding
	performance improvements, skill retention, and resistance to interference
	from native motor networks. These results highlight the utility of

  abstract = {Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have been used to assist people with
	impairments since many years. In most of these applications the BCI
	is intended to substitute functions the user is no longer able to
	perform without help. For example BCIs could be used for communication
	and for control of devices like robotic arms, wheelchairs or also
	orthoses and prostheses. Another approach is not to replace the motor
	function itself by controlling a BCI, but to utilize a BCI for rehabilitation
	that enables the user to restore normal or "more normal" motor function.
	Motor imagery (MI) itself is a common strategy for motor rehabilitation
	in stroke patients. The idea of this paper is it to assist the MI
	by presenting online feedback about the imagination to the user.
	A BCI is presented that classifies MI of the left hand versus the
	right hand. Feedback is given to the user with two different strategies.
	One time by an abstract bar feedback, and the second time by a 3-D

  abstract = {Evidence suggests that the CNS uses motor primitives to simplify movement
	control, but whether it actually stores primitives instead of computing
	solutions on the fly to satisfy task demands is a controversial and
	still-unanswered possibility. Also in contention is whether these
	primitives take the form of time-invariant muscle coactivations ("spatial"
	synergies) or time-varying muscle commands ("spatiotemporal" synergies).
	Here, we examined forelimb muscle patterns and motor cortical spiking
	data in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) handling objects of variable
	shape and size. From these data, we extracted both spatiotemporal
	and spatial synergies using non-negative decomposition. Each spatiotemporal
	synergy represents a sequence of muscular or neural activations that
	appeared to recur frequently during the animals' behavior. Key features
	of the spatiotemporal synergies (including their dimensionality,
	timing, and amplitude modulation) were independently observed in
	the muscular and neural data. In addition, both at the muscular and
	neural levels, these spatiotemporal synergies could be readily reconstructed
	as sequential activations of spatial synergies (a subset of those
	extracted independently from the task data), suggestive of a hierarchical
	relationship between the two levels of synergies. The possibility
	that motor cortex may execute even complex skill using spatiotemporal
	synergies has novel implications for the design of neuroprosthetic
	devices, which could gain computational efficiency by adopting the
	discrete and low-dimensional control that these primitives imply.
	SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: We studied the motor cortical and forearm
	muscular activity of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) as they reached,
	grasped, and carried objects of varied shape and size. We applied
	non-negative matrix factorization separately to the cortical and
	muscular data to reduce their dimensionality to a smaller set of
	time-varying "spatiotemporal" synergies. Each synergy represents
	a sequence of cortical or muscular activity that recurred frequently
	during the animals' behavior. Salient features of the synergies (including
	their dimensionality, timing, and amplitude modulation) were observed
	at both the cortical and muscular levels. The possibility that the
	brain may execute even complex behaviors using spatiotemporal synergies
	has implications for neuroprosthetic algorithm design, which could
	become more computationally efficient by adopting the discrete and
	low-dimensional control that they afford.},

	unclear. Because of the increasing use of EEG-based brain-computer-interface
	rehabilitation, we examined lesion location-dependent EEG patterns
	in patients with stroke while they performed motor tasks. METHODS:
	Twelve patients with chronic stroke were divided into three subgroups
	according to their lesion locations: supratentorial lesions that
	included M1 (SM1+), supratentorial lesions that excluded M1 (SM1-),
	and infratentorial (INF) lesions. Participants performed three motor
	tasks [active, passive, and motor imagery (MI)] with supination and
	grasping movements. The hemispheric asymmetric indexes, which were
	calculated with laterality coefficients (LCs), the temporal changes
	in the event-related desynchronization (ERD) patterns in the bilateral
	motor cortex, and the topographical distributions in the 28-channel
	EEG patterns around the supplementary motor area and bilateral motor
	cortex of the three participant subgroups were compared with those
	of the 12 age-matched healthy controls. RESULTS: The SM1+ group exhibited
	negative LC values in the active and MI motor tasks, while the other
	patient subgroups exhibited positive LC values. Negative LC values
	indicate that the ERD/ERS intensity of the ipsilateral hemisphere
	is higher than the contralateral hemisphere, whereas positive LC
	values indicate that the ERD/ERS intensity of the contralateral hemisphere
	is higher than the ipsilateral hemisphere. The LC values of SM1+
	and healthy controls differed significantly (rank-sum test, p < 0.05)
	in both the supination and grasping movements in the active task.
	The three patient subgroups differed distinctly from each other in
	the topography analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The hemispheric asymmetry and
	topographic characteristics of the beta band power patterns in the
	patients with stroke differed according to the location of the lesion,
	which suggested that EEG analyses of neurorehabilitation should be

	Learning was measured by the size of the aftereffect upon return

	We found that the error size did not affect learning. Unexpectedly,

	that of Day 1, and did not influence learning in adults. Hence, 11

  abstract = {The formation of new motor memories, which is fundamental for efficient
	performance during adaptation to a visuo-motor rotation, occurs when
	accurate planning is achieved mostly with feedforward mechanisms.
	The dynamics of brain activity underlying the switch from feedback
	to feedforward control is still matter of debate. Based on the results
	of studies in declarative learning, it is likely that phase synchronization
	of low and high frequencies as well as their temporal modulation
	in power amplitude underlie the formation of new motor memories during
	visuo-motor adaptation. High-density EEG (256 electrodes) was recorded
	in 17 normal human subjects during adaptation to a visuo-motor rotation
	of 60 degrees in four incremental steps of 15 degrees . We found
	that initial learning is associated with enhancement of gamma power
	in a right parietal region during movement execution as well as gamma/theta
	phase coherence during movement planning. Late stages of learning
	are instead accompanied by an increase of theta power over that same
	right parietal region during movement planning, which is correlated
	with the degree of learning and retention. Altogether, these results
	suggest that the formation of new motor memories and, thus, the switch
	from feedback to feedforward control is associated with the modulation
	of gamma and theta spectral activities, with respect to their amplitude
	and phase, during movement planning and execution. Specifically,
	we propose that gamma/theta phase coupling plays a pivotal role in
	the integration of a new representation into motor memories.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Performing foot motor imagery is accompanied by a peri-imagery
	ERD and a post-imagery beta ERS (beta rebound). Our aim was to study
	whether the post-imagery beta rebound is a suitable feature for a
	simple "brain switch". Such a brain switch is a specifically designed
	brain-computer interface (BCI) with the aim to detect only one predefined
	brain state (e.g. EEG pattern) in ongoing brain activity. METHOD:
	One EEG (Laplacian) recorded at the vertex during cue-based brisk
	foot motor imagery was analysed in 5 healthy subjects. The peri-imagery
	ERD and the post-imagery beta rebound (ERS) were analysed in detail
	between 6 and 40Hz and classified with two support vector machines.
	RESULTS: The ERD was detected in ongoing EEG (simulation of asynchronous
	BCI) with a true positive rate (TPR) of 28.4%+/-13.5 and the beta
	rebound with a TPR of 59.2%+/-20.3. In single runs with 30 cues each,
	the TPR for beta rebound detection was 78.6%+/-12.8. The false positive
	rate was always kept below 10%. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest
	that the beta rebound at Cz during foot motor imagery is a relatively
	stable and reproducible phenomenon detectable in single EEG trials.
	SIGNIFICANCE: Our results indicate that the beta rebound is a suitable
	feature to realize a "brain switch" with one single EEG (Laplacian)
	channel only.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Motor imagery (MI) is assumed to enhance poststroke motor
	recovery, yet its benefits are debatable. Brain-computer interfaces
	(BCIs) can provide instantaneous and quantitative measure of cerebral
	functions modulated by MI. The efficacy of BCI-monitored MI practice
	as add-on intervention to usual rehabilitation care was evaluated
	in a randomized controlled pilot study in subacute stroke patients.
	METHODS: Twenty-eight hospitalized subacute stroke patients with
	severe motor deficits were randomized into 2 intervention groups:
	1-month BCI-supported MI training (BCI group, n = 14) and 1-month
	MI training without BCI support (control group; n = 14). Functional
	and neurophysiological assessments were performed before and after
	the interventions, including evaluation of the upper limbs by Fugl-Meyer
	Assessment (FMA; primary outcome measure) and analysis of oscillatory
	activity and connectivity at rest, based on high-density electroencephalographic
	(EEG) recordings. RESULTS: Better functional outcome was observed
	in the BCI group, including a significantly higher probability of
	achieving a clinically relevant increase in the FMA score (p < 0.03).
	Post-BCI training changes in EEG sensorimotor power spectra (ie,
	stronger desynchronization in the alpha and beta bands) occurred
	with greater involvement of the ipsilesional hemisphere in response
	to MI of the paralyzed trained hand. Also, FMA improvements (effectiveness
	of FMA) correlated with the changes (ie, post-training increase)
	at rest in ipsilesional intrahemispheric connectivity in the same
	bands (p < 0.05). INTERPRETATION: The introduction of BCI technology
	in assisting MI practice demonstrates the rehabilitative potential
	of MI, contributing to significantly better motor functional outcomes
	in subacute stroke patients with severe motor impairments.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is now sufficient evidence that using a rehabilitation
	protocol involving motor imagery (MI) practice in conjunction with
	physical practice (PP) of goal-directed rehabilitation tasks leads
	to enhanced functional recovery of paralyzed limbs among stroke sufferers.
	It is however difficult to confirm patient engagement during an MI
	in the absence of any on-line measure. Fortunately an EEG-based brain-computer
	interface (BCI) can provide an on-line measure of MI activity as
	a neurofeedback for the BCI user to help him/her focus better on
	the MI task. However initial performance of novice BCI users may
	be quite moderate and may cause frustration. This paper reports a
	pilot study in which a BCI system is used to provide a computer game-based
	neurofeedback to stroke participants during the MI part of a protocol.
	METHODS: The participants included five chronic hemiplegic stroke
	sufferers. Participants received up to twelve 30-minute MI practice
	sessions (in conjunction with PP sessions of the same duration) on
	2 days a week for 6 weeks. The BCI neurofeedback performance was
	evaluated based on the MI task classification accuracy (CA) rate.
	A set of outcome measures including action research arm test (ARAT)
	and grip strength (GS), was made use of in assessing the upper limb
	functional recovery. In addition, since stroke sufferers often experience
	physical tiredness, which may influence the protocol effectiveness,
	their fatigue and mood levels were assessed regularly. RESULTS: Positive
	improvement in at least one of the outcome measures was observed
	in all the participants, while improvements approached a minimal
	clinically important difference (MCID) for the ARAT. The on-line
	CA of MI induced sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) modulation patterns in
	the form of lateralized event-related desynchronization (ERD) and
	event-related synchronization (ERS) effects, for novice participants
	was in a moderate range of 60-75% within the limited 12 training
	sessions. The ERD/ERS change from the first to the last session was
	statistically significant for only two participants. CONCLUSIONS:
	Overall the crucial observation is that the moderate BCI classification
	performance did not impede the positive rehabilitation trends as
	quantified with the rehabilitation outcome measures adopted in this
	study. Therefore it can be concluded that the BCI supported MI is
	a feasible intervention as part of a post-stroke rehabilitation protocol
	combining both PP and MI practice of rehabilitation tasks. Although
	these findings are promising, the scope of the final conclusions
	is limited by the small sample size and the lack of a control group.},

	deviate from experimentally measured torques as the arm goes through
	the range. Subjects with disabilities also maximally pushed and pulled
	against the force sensor to measure maximum strength as a function

	cortical stimulation on the extended time course of learning a novel

	shifts in the task's speed-accuracy tradeoff function (SAF), which
	prevented us from falsely interpreting variations in position along
	an unchanged SAF as a change in skill. Subjects practiced over 5
	consecutive days while receiving transcranial direct current stimulation

	There was greater total (online plus offline) skill acquisition with

	enhancement of offline effects. Anodal tDCS did not change the rate
	of forgetting relative to sham across the 3-month follow-up period,
	and consequently the skill measure remained greater with anodal tDCS
	at 3 months. This prolonged enhancement may hold promise for the
	rehabilitation of brain injury. Furthermore, these findings support
	the existence of a consolidation mechanism, susceptible to anodal
	tDCS, which contributes to offline effects but not to online effects

  abstract = {Locomotion is incredibly flexible. Humans are able to stay upright
	and navigate long distances in the face of ever-changing environments
	and varied task demands, such as walking while carrying a heavy object
	or in thick mud. The focus of this review is a behavior that is critical
	for this flexibility: motor adaptation. Adaptation is defined here
	as the process of adjusting a movement to new demands through trial-and-error
	practice. A key feature of adaptation is that more practice without
	the new demand is required to return the movement to its original
	state. Thus, motor adaptation is a short-term motor learning process.
	Several studies have been undertaken to determine how humans adapt
	walking to novel circumstances. Many of these studies have examined
	locomotor adaptation using a split-belt treadmill. The results of
	these studies of people who were healthy and people with neurologic
	damage suggest that the cerebellum is required for normal adaptation
	of walking and that the role of cerebral structures may be less critical.
	They also suggest that intersegmental and interlimb coordination
	is critical but readily adaptable to accommodate changes in the environment.
	Locomotor adaptation also can be used to determine the walking potential
	of people with specific neurologic deficits. For instance, split-belt
	and limb-weighting locomotor adaptation studies show that adults
	with chronic stroke are capable of improving weight-bearing and spatiotemporal
	symmetry, at least temporarily. Our challenge as rehabilitation specialists
	is to intervene in ways that maximize this capacity.},

  abstract = {Interlimb coordination is critically important during bipedal locomotion
	and often must be adapted to account for varying environmental circumstances.
	Here we studied adaptation of human interlimb coordination using
	a split-belt treadmill, where the legs can be made to move at different
	speeds. Human adults, infants, and spinal cats can alter walking
	patterns on a split-belt treadmill by prolonging stance and shortening
	swing on the slower limb and vice versa on the faster limb. It is
	not known whether other locomotor parameters change or if there is
	a capacity for storage of a new motor pattern after training. We
	asked whether adults adapt both intra- and interlimb gait parameters
	during split-belt walking and show aftereffects from training. Healthy
	subjects were tested walking with belts tied (baseline), then belts
	split (adaptation), and again tied (postadaptation). Walking parameters
	that directly relate to the interlimb relationship changed slowly
	during adaptation and showed robust aftereffects during postadaptation.
	These changes paralleled subjective impressions of limping versus
	no limping. In contrast, parameters calculated from an individual
	leg changed rapidly to accommodate split-belts and showed no aftereffects.
	These results suggest some independence of neural control of intra-
	versus interlimb parameters during walking. They also show that the
	adult nervous system can adapt and store new interlimb patterns after
	short bouts of training. The differences in intra- versus interlimb
	control may be related to the varying complexity of the parameters,
	task demands, and/or the level of neural control necessary for their
	adaptation.},

  abstract = {Human locomotion must be flexible in order to meet varied environmental
	demands. Alterations to the gait pattern occur on different time
	scales, ranging from fast, reactive adjustments to slower, more persistent
	adaptations. A recent study in humans demonstrated that the cerebellum
	plays a key role in slower walking adaptations in interlimb coordination
	during split-belt treadmill walking, but not fast reactive changes.
	It is not known whether cerebral structures are also important in
	these processes, though some studies of cats have suggested that
	they are not. We used a split-belt treadmill walking task to test
	whether cerebral damage from stroke impairs either type of flexibility.
	Thirteen individuals who had sustained a single stroke more than
	6 months prior to the study (four females) and 13 age- and gender-matched
	healthy control subjects were recruited to participate in the study.
	Results showed that stroke involving cerebral structures did not
	impair either reactive or adaptive abilities and did not disrupt
	storage of new interlimb relationships (i.e. after-effects). This
	suggests that cerebellar interactions with brainstem, rather than
	cerebral structures, comprise the critical circuit for this type
	of interlimb control. Furthermore, the after-effects from a 15-min
	adaptation session could temporarily induce symmetry in subjects
	who demonstrated baseline asymmetry of spatiotemporal gait parameters.
	In order to re-establish symmetric walking, the choice of which leg
	is on the fast belt during split-belt walking must be based on the
	subject's initial asymmetry. These findings demonstrate that cerebral
	stroke survivors are indeed able to adapt interlimb coordination.
	This raises the possibility that asymmetric walking patterns post-stroke
	could be remediated utilizing the split-belt treadmill as a long-term
	rehabilitation strategy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Scale-invariant neuronal avalanches have been observed
	in cell cultures and slices as well as anesthetized and awake brains,
	suggesting that the brain operates near criticality, i.e. within
	a narrow margin between avalanche propagation and extinction. In
	theory, criticality provides many desirable features for the behaving
	brain, optimizing computational capabilities, information transmission,
	sensitivity to sensory stimuli and size of memory repertoires. However,
	a thorough characterization of neuronal avalanches in freely-behaving
	(FB) animals is still missing, thus raising doubts about their relevance
	for brain function. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To address this
	issue, we employed chronically implanted multielectrode arrays (MEA)
	to record avalanches of action potentials (spikes) from the cerebral
	cortex and hippocampus of 14 rats, as they spontaneously traversed
	the wake-sleep cycle, explored novel objects or were subjected to
	anesthesia (AN). We then modeled spike avalanches to evaluate the
	impact of sparse MEA sampling on their statistics. We found that
	the size distribution of spike avalanches are well fit by lognormal
	distributions in FB animals, and by truncated power laws in the AN
	group. FB data surrogation markedly decreases the tail of the distribution,
	i.e. spike shuffling destroys the largest avalanches. The FB data
	are also characterized by multiple key features compatible with criticality
	in the temporal domain, such as 1/f spectra and long-term correlations
	as measured by detrended fluctuation analysis. These signatures are
	very stable across waking, slow-wave sleep and rapid-eye-movement
	sleep, but collapse during anesthesia. Likewise, waiting time distributions
	obey a single scaling function during all natural behavioral states,
	but not during anesthesia. Results are equivalent for neuronal ensembles
	recorded from visual and tactile areas of the cerebral cortex, as
	well as the hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Altogether, the
	data provide a comprehensive link between behavior and brain criticality,
	revealing a unique scale-invariant regime of spike avalanches across
	all major behaviors.},

	modulated during center-out arm movements. Analysis of LFPs in the
	time domain showed that the amplitude of a slow complex waveform
	beginning shortly before the onset of arm movement is modulated with
	the direction of the movement. Examining LFPs in the frequency domain,

	ranges, which typically increased their amplitudes before and during

	in a frequency band approximately 30 Hz was not modulated with the
	direction of movement and typically decreased its amplitude during

	be divided into at least two functionally different regimes: one
	approximately 30 Hz and one >60 Hz. Furthermore, using multiple LFPs,

	repetitive TMS to test the hypothesis that M1 is intimately involved

	burst stimulation was applied to M1 prior to a task requiring modification
	of torques generated about the elbow/forearm complex in response
	to rotations of a visual feedback display. Participants were first
	exposed to a 30 degrees clockwise (CW) rotation (Block A), then a
	60 degrees counterclockwise rotation (Block B), followed immediately
	by a second block of 30 degrees CW rotation (A2). In the STIM condition,
	participants received 20s of continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS)
	prior to the initial A Block. In the conventional (CON) condition,
	no stimulation was applied. The overt characteristics of performance
	in the two conditions were essentially equivalent with respect to
	the errors exhibited upon exposure to a new variant of the task.
	There were however, profound differences between the conditions in
	the latency of response preparation, and the excitability of corticospinal
	projections from M1, which accompanied phases of de-adaptation and
	re-adaptation (during Blocks B and A2). Upon subsequent exposure
	to the A rotation 24h later, the rate of re-adaptation was lower
	in the stimulation condition than that present in the conventional
	condition. These results support the assertion that primary motor
	cortex assumes a key role in a network that mediates adaptation to
	visuomotor perturbation, and emphasise that it is engaged functionally

	progressively improve gait patterns with rehabilitation. Here, we
	used a split-belt treadmill to study precisely how people save newly
	learned walking patterns. In Experiment 1, we investigated savings
	by systematically varying the learning and unlearning environments.
	Savings was predominantly influenced by 1) previous exposure to similar
	abrupt changes in the environment and 2) the amount of exposure to
	the new environment. Relearning was fastest when these two factors
	coincided, and we did not observe savings after the environment was
	introduced gradually during initial learning. In Experiment 2, we
	then studied whether people store explicit information about different
	walking environments that mirrors savings of a new walking pattern.
	Like savings, we found that previous exposure to abrupt changes in
	the environment also drove the ability to recall a previously experienced
	walking environment accurately. Crucially, the information recalled
	was extrinsic information about the learning environment (i.e., treadmill
	speeds) and not intrinsic information about the walking pattern itself.
	We conclude that simply learning a new walking pattern is not enough
	for long-term savings; rather, savings of a learned walking pattern
	involves recall of the environment or extended training at the learned

  abstract = {Given the high incidence of brain injury in the population, brain
	damage rehabilitation is still a relatively undeveloped field. Virtual
	reality (VR) has the potential to assist current rehabilitation techniques
	in addressing the impairments, disabilities, and handicaps associated
	with brain damage. The main focus of much of the exploratory research
	performed to date has been to investigate the use of VR in the assessment
	of cognitive abilities, but there is now a trend for more studies
	to encompass rehabilitation training strategies. This review describes
	studies that have used VR in the assessment and rehabilitation of
	specific disabilities resulting from brain injury, including executive
	dysfunction, memory impairments, spatial ability impairments, attention
	deficits, and unilateral visual neglect. In addition, it describes
	studies that have used VR to try to offset some of the handicaps
	that people experience after brain injury. Finally, a table is included
	which, although not an exhaustive list of everything that has been
	published, includes many more studies that are relevant to the use
	of VR in the assessment and rehabilitation of brain damage. The review
	concludes that the use of VR in brain damage rehabilitation is expanding
	dramatically and will become an integral part of cognitive assessment
	and rehabilitation in the future.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mirrored feedback has potential as a therapeutic intervention
	to restore hand function after stroke. However, the functional (effective)
	connectivity of neural networks involved in processing mirrored feedback
	after stroke is not known. OBJECTIVE: To determine if regions recruited
	by mirrored feedback topographically overlap with those involved
	in control of the paretic hand and to identify the effective connectivity
	of activated nodes within the mirrored feedback network. METHODS:
	Fifteen patients with chronic stroke performed a finger flexion task
	with their unaffected hand during event-related functional magnetic
	resonance imaging (fMRI). Real-time hand kinematics was recorded
	during fMRI and used to actuate hand models presented in virtual
	reality (VR). Visual feedback of the unaffected hand motion was manipulated
	pseudorandomly by either actuating the VR hand corresponding to the
	moving unaffected side (veridical feedback) or the affected side
	(mirrored feedback). In 2 control conditions, the VR hands were replaced
	with moving nonanthropomorphic shapes. RESULTS: Mirrored feedback
	was associated with significant activation of regions within and
	outside the ipsilesional sensorimotor cortex, overlapping with areas
	engaged when patients performed the task with their affected hand.
	Effective connectivity analysis showed a significantly interconnected
	ipsilesional somatosensory and motor cortex in the mirrored feedback
	condition. CONCLUSIONS: Mirrored feedback recruits ipsilesional brain
	areas relevant for control of the affected hand. These data provide
	a neurophysiological basis by which mirrored feedback may be beneficial
	as a therapy for restoring function after stroke.},

	force field, we sought to determine the relative role of kinematic
	errors and dynamic criteria in promoting recovery from the adapted

	novel field was much slower compared with when kinematic aftereffects
	were allowed to take place. In particular, when kinematic errors
	were prevented, subjects persisted in generating large forces that
	were unnecessary to generate an accurate reach. The magnitude of
	these forces decreased slowly over time, at a much slower rate than
	when subjects were allowed to make kinematic errors. This finding
	provides strong experimental evidence that both kinematic and dynamic

	in pediatric rehabilitation. Therefore, virtual environments were
	developed to enhance robotic assisted gait training. The purpose
	of this study was to evaluate virtual realities as motivational tools

	LokomatÂ®. Nine children with different gait disorders and eight
	healthy children participated in the study. Muscular effort of the
	lower leg was assessed by surface electromyography during a randomly

	electromyographic activity output in both groups was significantly
	higher during tasks with virtual realities than during normal walking
	conditions. These results support that virtual realities seem to
	be efficient motivational tools to increase children's muscular effort
	in the pediatric LokomatÂ®. The gaming aspect of virtual realities
	keeps children highly engaged during repetitive tasks.},

  abstract = {Investigating human brain function is essential to develop models
	of cortical involvement during walking. Such models could advance
	the analysis of motor impairments following brain injuries (e.g.,
	stroke) and may lead to novel rehabilitation approaches. In this
	work, we applied high-density EEG source imaging based on individual
	anatomy to enable neuroimaging during walking. To minimize the impact
	of muscular influence on EEG recordings we introduce a novel artifact
	correction method based on spectral decomposition. High gamma oscillations
	(>60Hz) were previously reported to play an important role in motor
	control. Here, we investigate high gamma amplitudes while focusing
	on two different aspects of a walking experiment, namely the fact
	that a person walks and the rhythmicity of walking. We found that
	high gamma amplitudes (60-80Hz), located focally in central sensorimotor
	areas, were significantly increased during walking compared to standing.
	Moreover, high gamma (70-90Hz) amplitudes in the same areas are modulated
	in relation to the gait cycle. Since the spectral peaks of high gamma
	amplitude increase and modulation do not match, it is plausible that
	these two high gamma elements represent different frequency-specific
	network interactions. Interestingly, we found high gamma (70-90Hz)
	amplitudes to be coupled to low gamma (24-40Hz) amplitudes, which
	both are modulated in relation to the gait cycle but conversely to
	each other. In summary, our work is a further step towards modeling
	cortical involvement during human upright walking.},

	in central sensorimotor areas for 9/10 subjects. Additionally, we
	found that low gamma (24-40 Hz) amplitudes were modulated related
	to the gait phase. Because there is a certain frequency band overlap
	between sustained beta ERD and gait phase related modulations in
	the low gamma range, these two phenomena are superimposed. Thus,
	we observe gait phase related amplitude modulations at a certain
	ERD level. We conclude that sustained mu and beta ERD reflect a movement
	related state change of cortical excitability while gait phase related
	modulations in the low gamma represent the motion sequence timing
	during gait. Interestingly, the center frequencies of sustained beta
	ERD and gait phase modulated amplitudes were identified to be different.
	They may therefore be caused by different neuronal rhythms, which
	should be taken under consideration in future studies.},

	cortex, mediating object perception [1â€“3]. Between these structures

	Lesions here can lead to spatial neglect [4, 5], a condition associated

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Intracortical brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) have predominantly
	utilized spike activity as the control signal. However, an increasing
	number of studies have shown the utility of local field potentials
	(LFPs) for decoding motor related signals. Currently, it is unclear
	how well different LFP frequencies can serve as features for continuous,
	closed-loop BMI control. APPROACH: We demonstrate 2D continuous LFP-based
	BMI control using closed-loop decoder adaptation, which adapts decoder
	parameters to subject-specific LFP feature modulations during BMI
	control. We trained two macaque monkeys to control a 2D cursor in
	a center-out task by modulating LFP power in the 0-150 Hz range.
	MAIN RESULTS: While both monkeys attained control, they used different
	strategies involving different frequency bands. One monkey primarily
	utilized the low-frequency spectrum (0-80 Hz), which was highly correlated
	between channels, and obtained proficient performance even with a
	single channel. In contrast, the other monkey relied more on higher
	frequencies (80-150 Hz), which were less correlated between channels,
	and had greater difficulty with control as the number of channels
	decreased. We then restricted the monkeys to use only various sub-ranges
	(0-40, 40-80, and 80-150 Hz) of the 0-150 Hz band. Interestingly,
	although both monkeys performed better with some sub-ranges than
	others, they were able to achieve BMI control with all sub-ranges
	after decoder adaptation, demonstrating broad flexibility in the
	frequencies that could potentially be used for LFP-based BMI control.
	SIGNIFICANCE: Overall, our results demonstrate proficient, continuous
	BMI control using LFPs and provide insight into the subject-specific
	spectral patterns of LFP activity modulated during control.},

  abstract = {Redundant encoding of information facilitates reliable distributed
	information processing. To explore this hypothesis in the motor system,
	we applied concepts from information theory to quantify the redundancy
	of movement-related information encoded in the macaque primary motor
	cortex (M1) during natural and neuroprosthetic control. Two macaque
	monkeys were trained to perform a delay center-out reaching task
	controlling a computer cursor under natural arm movement (manual
	control, 'MC'), and using a brain-machine interface (BMI) via volitional
	control of neural ensemble activity (brain control, 'BC'). During
	MC, we found neurons in contralateral M1 to contain higher and more
	redundant information about target direction than ipsilateral M1
	neurons, consistent with the laterality of movement control. During
	BC, we found that the M1 neurons directly incorporated into the BMI
	('direct' neurons) contained the highest and most redundant target
	information compared to neurons that were not incorporated into the
	BMI ('indirect' neurons). This effect was even more significant when
	comparing to M1 neurons of the opposite hemisphere. Interestingly,
	when we retrained the BMI to use ipsilateral M1 activity, we found
	that these neurons were more redundant and contained higher information
	than contralateral M1 neurons, even though ensembles from this hemisphere
	were previously less redundant during natural arm movement. These
	results indicate that ensembles most associated to movement contain
	highest redundancy and information encoding, which suggests a role
	for redundancy in proficient natural and prosthetic motor control.},

	learning and memory, but less is known about the effect of exercise
	on motor learning. Here we sought to determine the effect of a single
	bout of moderate intensity aerobic exercise on motor skill learning.
	In experiment 1, we investigated the effect of moderate aerobic exercise
	on motor acquisition. 24 young, healthy adults performed a motor
	learning task either immediately after 30 minutes of moderate intensity
	running, after running followed by a long rest period, or after slow
	walking. Motor skill was assessed via a speed-accuracy tradeoff function
	to determine how exercise might differentially affect two distinct
	components of motor learning performance: movement speed and accuracy.
	In experiment 2, we investigated both acquisition and retention of
	motor skill across multiple days of training. 20 additional participants
	performed either a bout of running or slow walking immediately before
	motor learning on three consecutive days, and only motor learning
	(no exercise) on a fourth day. We found that moderate intensity running
	led to an immediate improvement in motor acquisition for both a single
	session and on multiple sessions across subsequent days, but had
	no effect on between-day retention. This effect was driven by improved
	movement accuracy, as opposed to speed. However, the benefit of exercise
	was dependent upon motor learning occurring immediately after exercise-resting
	for a period of one hour after exercise diminished the effect. These
	results demonstrate that moderate intensity exercise can prime the
	nervous system for the acquisition of new motor skills, and suggest
	that similar exercise protocols may be effective in improving the
	outcomes of movement rehabilitation programs.},

	Forces were applied to the arm, which curved the hand path in either

	The subjects exhibited a decreased ability to adapt to the perturbing

	and they exhibited smaller aftereffects when the perturbing force
	was unexpectedly removed. The ability to adapt to the force improved
	significantly with decreasing impairment severity, as quantified
	using both clinical scales and quantitative strength measurements.
	Some subjects with strength reductions as severe as 60% were able

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Increasing evidence suggests that use of augmented visual
	feedback could be a useful approach to stroke rehabilitation. In
	current clinical practice, visual feedback of movement performance
	is often limited to the use of mirrors or video. However, neither
	approach is optimal since cognitive and self-image issues can distract
	or distress patients and their movement can be obscured by clothing
	or limited viewpoints. Three-dimensional motion capture has the potential
	to provide accurate kinematic data required for objective assessment
	and feedback in the clinical environment. However, such data are
	currently presented in numerical or graphical format, which is often
	impractical in a clinical setting. Our hypothesis is that presenting
	this kinematic data using bespoke visualisation software, which is
	tailored for gait rehabilitation after stroke, will provide a means
	whereby feedback of movement performance can be communicated in a
	more meaningful way to patients. This will result in increased patient
	understanding of their rehabilitation and will enable progress to
	be tracked in a more accessible way. METHODS:The hypothesis will
	be assessed using an exploratory (phase II) randomised controlled
	trial. Stroke survivors eligible for this trial will be in the subacute
	stage of stroke and have impaired walking ability (Functional Ambulation
	Classification of 1 or more). Participants (nâ€‰=â€‰45) will be randomised
	into three groups to compare the use of the visualisation software
	during overground physical therapy gait training against an intensity-matched
	and attention-matched placebo group and a usual care control group.
	The primary outcome measure will be walking speed. Secondary measures
	will be Functional Ambulation Category, Timed Up and Go, Rivermead
	Visual Gait Assessment, Stroke Impact Scale-16 and spatiotemporal
	parameters associated with walking. Additional qualitative measures
	will be used to assess the participant's experience of the visual
	feedback provided in the study. DISCUSSION:Results from the trial
	will explore whether the early provision of visual feedback of biomechanical
	movement performance during gait rehabilitation demonstrates improved
	mobility outcomes after stroke and increased patient understanding
	of their rehabilitation. TRIAL REGISTRATION:Current Controlled Trials

  abstract = {Successful behavior demands motor learning to be transferable in some
	cases (e.g., adjusting walking patterns as we develop and age) and
	context specific in others (e.g., learning to walk in high heels).
	Here we investigated differences in motor learning transfer in people
	learning a new walking pattern on a split-belt treadmill, where the
	legs move at different speeds. We hypothesized that transfer of the
	newly acquired walking pattern on the treadmill to natural over ground
	walking might depend on the pattern of errors experienced during
	learning. Error patterns within a person's natural range might be
	experienced as endogenous (i.e., produced by the body), encouraging
	general adjustments that transfer across contexts. On the other hand,
	larger errors might be experienced as exogenous (i.e., produced by
	the environment), indicating unusual conditions requiring context-specific
	learning. To test this, we manipulated the distribution of errors
	experienced during learning to lie either within or outside the normal
	distribution of walking errors. We found that restriction of errors
	to the natural range produced transfer of the new walking pattern
	from the treadmill to natural walking off the treadmill, while larger
	errors prevented transfer. This result helps explain how transfer
	of motor learning is controlled, and it offers an important strategy
	for clinical rehabilitation, where transfer of motor learning to
	other contexts is essential.},

  abstract = {Stroke survivors without cerebellar involvement retain the ability
	to adapt to the split-belt treadmill; however it has been suggested
	that their rate of adaptation may be slowed compared to those who
	are neurologically intact. Depending on limb placement, the split-belt
	treadmill can be configured to either exaggerate baseline asymmetry,
	or reduce it, which may affect the behavior of adaptation or de-adaptation.
	The objectives of this study were to characterize the rate and magnitude
	of locomotor (de)adaptation in chronic stroke survivors compared
	to healthy matched subjects, and to evaluate whether exaggeration
	or reduction of baseline asymmetry impact the responses. Seventeen
	stroke survivors and healthy subjects completed 10min of split-belt
	treadmill walking, then 5min of tied-belt walking. Stroke survivors
	completed this once with each leg on the fast belt. Magnitude and
	rate of (de)adaptation were evaluated for step length and limb phase
	asymmetry. There were no differences between the groups with the
	exception of the reduced step length asymmetry configuration, in
	which case there was a significantly reduced magnitude (p</=0.000)
	and rate (p=0.011) of adaptation when compared to controls. There
	was a similar trend observed during post-adaptation for the exaggerated
	asymmetry group. The rate and magnitude of locomotor (de)adaptation
	is similar between chronic stroke survivors and neurologically intact
	controls, except when the adaptation or de-adaptation response would
	take the stroke survivors away from a symmetric step length pattern.
	This suggests that there may be some benefit to symmetry that is
	recognized by the system.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an extensive review on the artifact removal algorithms
	used to remove the main sources of interference encountered in the
	electroencephalogram (EEG), specifically ocular, muscular and cardiac
	artifacts. We first introduce background knowledge on the characteristics
	of EEG activity, of the artifacts and of the EEG measurement model.
	Then, we present algorithms commonly employed in the literature and
	describe their key features. Lastly, principally on the basis of
	the results provided by various researchers, but also supported by
	our own experience, we compare the state-of-the-art methods in terms
	of reported performance, and provide guidelines on how to choose
	a suitable artifact removal algorithm for a given scenario. With
	this review we have concluded that, without prior knowledge of the
	recorded EEG signal or the contaminants, the safest approach is to
	correct the measured EEG using independent component analysis-to
	be precise, an algorithm based on second-order statistics such as
	second-order blind identification (SOBI). Other effective alternatives
	include extended information maximization (InfoMax) and an adaptive
	mixture of independent component analyzers (AMICA), based on higher
	order statistics. All of these algorithms have proved particularly
	effective with simulations and, more importantly, with data collected
	in controlled recording conditions. Moreover, whenever prior knowledge
	is available, then a constrained form of the chosen method should
	be used in order to incorporate such additional information. Finally,
	since which algorithm is the best performing is highly dependent
	on the type of the EEG signal, the artifacts and the signal to contaminant
	ratio, we believe that the optimal method for removing artifacts
	from the EEG consists in combining more than one algorithm to correct
	the signal using multiple processing stages, even though this is
	an option largely unexplored by researchers in the area.},

  abstract = {Functional arm movements, such as reaching while standing, are planned

	and are relative to environmental objects. The angle under which
	the environment is observed is one component used in creating this
	perception. This suggests that manipulation of viewing angle may
	modulate whole body movement to affect performance. We tested this
	by comparing its effect on reaching in a virtually generated environment.
	Eleven young healthy individuals performed forward and lateral reaches
	in the virtual environment, presented on a flat screen in third-person
	perspective. Participants saw a computer-generated model (avatar)
	of themselves standing in a courtyard facing a semi-circular hedge
	with flowers. The image was presented in five different viewing angles
	ranging from seeing the avatar from behind (0 degrees), to viewing
	from overhead (90 degrees). Participants attempted to touch the furthest
	flower possible without losing balance or stepping. Kinematic data
	were collected to analyze endpoint displacement, arm-postural coordination
	and center of mass (COM) displacement. Results showed that reach
	distance was greatest with angular perspectives of approximately
	45-77.5 degrees , which are larger than those used in analogous real
	world situations. Larger reaches were characterized by increased
	involvement of leg and trunk body segments, altered inter-segmental
	coordination, and decreased inter-segmental movement time lag. Thus
	a viewing angle can be a critical visuomotor variable modulating
	motor coordination of the whole body and related functional performance.
	These results can be used in designing virtual reality games, in
	ergonomic design, teleoperation training, and in designing virtual
	rehabilitation programs that re-train functional movement in vulnerable

  abstract = {New walking patterns can be learned over short time scales (i.e.,
	adapted in minutes) using a split-belt treadmill that controls the
	speed of each leg independently. This leads to storage of a modified
	motor pattern that is expressed as an aftereffect in regular walking
	conditions and must be de-adapted to return to normal. Here we asked
	whether the nervous system adapts a general walking pattern that
	is used across many speeds or a specific pattern affecting only the
	two speeds experienced during split-belt training. In experiment
	1, we tested three groups of healthy adult subjects walking at different
	split-belt speed combinations and then assessed aftereffects at a
	range of speeds. We found that aftereffects were largest at the slower
	speed that was used in split-belt training in all three groups, and
	it decayed gradually for all other speeds. Thus adaptation appeared
	to be more strongly linked to the slow walking speed. This result
	suggests a separation in the functional networks used for fast and
	slow walking. We tested this in experiment 2 by adapting walking
	to split belts and then determining how much fast regular walking
	washed out the slow aftereffect and vice versa. We found that 23-38%
	of the aftereffect remained regardless of which speed was washed
	out first. This demonstrates that there is only partial overlap in
	the functional networks coordinating different walking speeds. Taken
	together, our results suggest that there are some neural networks
	for controlling locomotion that are recruited specifically for fast
	versus slow walking in humans, similar to recent findings in other

	depends on effective interaction between two adaptive controllers,
	the user who encodes his or her commands in the electrophysiological
	input provided to the BCI, and the BCI that recognizes the commands
	contained in the input and expresses them in device control. Current
	BCIs have maximum information transfer rates of up to 25 b/min. Achievement
	of greater speed and accuracy requires improvements in signal acquisition
	and processing, in translation algorithms, and in user training.
	These improvements depend on interdisciplinary cooperation among
	neuroscientists, engineers, computer programmers, psychologists,
	and rehabilitation specialists, and on adoption and widespread application

  abstract = {In robot assisted gait training, a pattern of human locomotion is
	executed repetitively with the intention to restore the motor programs
	associated with walking. Several studies showed that active contribution
	to the movement is critical for the encoding of motor memory. We
	propose to use brain monitoring techniques during gait training to
	encourage active participation in the movement. We investigated the
	spectral patterns in the electroencephalogram (EEG) that are related
	to active and passive robot assisted gait. Fourteen healthy participants
	were considered. Infomax independent component analysis separated
	the EEG into independent components representing brain, muscle, and
	eye movement activity, as well as other artifacts. An equivalent
	current dipole was calculated for each independent component. Independent
	components were clustered across participants based on their anatomical
	position and frequency spectra. Four clusters were identified in
	the sensorimotor cortices that accounted for differences between
	active and passive walking or showed activity related to the gait
	cycle. We show that in central midline areas the mu (8-12 Hz) and
	beta (18-21 Hz) rhythms are suppressed during active compared to
	passive walking. These changes are statistically significant: mu
	(F(1, 13)=11.2 p </= 0.01) and beta (F(1, 13)=7.7, p </= 0.05). We
	also show that these differences depend on the gait cycle phases.
	We provide first evidence of modulations of the gamma rhythm in the
	band 25 to 40 Hz, localized in central midline areas related to the
	phases of the gait cycle. We observed a trend (F(1, 8)=11.03, p </=
	0.06) for suppressed low gamma rhythm when comparing active and passive
	walking. Additionally we found significant suppressions of the mu
	(F(1, 11)=20.1 p </= 0.01), beta (F(1, 11)=11.3 p </= 0.05) and gamma
	(F(1, 11)=4.9 p </= 0.05) rhythms near C3 (in the right hand area
	of the primary motor cortex) during phases of active vs. passive
	robot assisted walking. To our knowledge this is the first study
	showing EEG analysis during robot assisted walking. We provide evidence
	for significant differences in cortical activation between active
	and passive robot assisted gait. Our findings may help to define
	appropriate features for single trial detection of active participation
	in gait training. This work is a further step toward the evaluation
	of brain monitoring techniques and brain-computer interface technologies

	in the role that motor planning plays in gait movements. In this
	study we examined the impact of an interactive Virtual Environment
	(VE) feedback task on the EEG patterns during robot assisted walking.
	We compared walking in the VE modality to two control conditions:
	walking with a visual attention paradigm, in which visual stimuli
	were unrelated to the motor task; and walking with mirror feedback,
	in which participants observed their own movements. Eleven healthy
	participants were considered. Application of independent component
	analysis to the EEG revealed three independent component clusters
	in premotor and parietal areas showing increased activity during
	walking with the adaptive VE training paradigm compared to the control
	conditions. During the interactive VE walking task spectral power
	in frequency ranges 8-12, 15-20, and 23-40 Hz was significantly (p
	</= 0.05) decreased. This power decrease is interpreted as a correlate
	of an active cortical area. Furthermore activity in the premotor
	cortex revealed gait cycle related modulations significantly different
	(p </= 0.05) from baseline in the frequency range 23-40 Hz during
	walking. These modulations were significantly (p </= 0.05) reduced

	and movement unrelated feedback. Previous research has related a

	We argue that movement related interactive feedback enhances motor
	planning and motor intention. We hypothesize that this might improve

  abstract = {During motor adaptation the nervous system constantly uses error information
	to improve future movements. Today's mainstream models simply assume
	that the nervous system adapts linearly and proportionally to errors.
	However, not all movement errors are relevant to our own action.
	The environment may transiently disturb the movement production-for
	example, a gust of wind blows the tennis ball away from its intended
	trajectory. Apparently the nervous system should not adapt its motor
	plan in the subsequent tennis strokes based on this irrelevant movement
	error. We hypothesize that the nervous system estimates the relevance
	of each observed error and adapts strongly only to relevant errors.
	Here we present a Bayesian treatment of this problem. The model calculates
	how likely an error is relevant to the motor plant and derives an
	ideal adaptation strategy that leads to the most precise movements.
	This model predicts that adaptation should be a nonlinear function
	of the size of an error. In reaching experiments we found strong
	evidence for the predicted nonlinear strategy. The model also explains
	published data on saccadic gain adaptation, adaptation to visuomotor
	rotations, and force perturbations. Our study suggests that the nervous
	system constantly and effortlessly estimates the relevance of observed
	movement errors for successful motor adaptation.},

	affects brain activations related to knee movement. Thirty-two channel

	different conditions: no weight and no visual target (NWNT), weight
	affixed to the ankle and no visual target (WNT), no weight and a
	visual target (NWT), and both weight and target (WT). Surface electromyography
	(EMG) was recorded from the vastus medialis and vastus lateralis
	muscles to determine onset of the movement. EEG was epoched from
	-4.5 s before to 1 s after EMG onset. Epochs were averaged to acquire
	movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs) of each task condition.
	MRCP amplitude during the pre-movement period from -2 s to EMG onset
	was evaluated at electrodes over motor, sensory, frontal, and parietal
	areas. The amplitude of the pre-movement potentials for the conditions
	was different across areas of interest. Over the motor area, NWNT
	had lower amplitude than any other condition and WT had higher amplitude
	than any other condition. There was no difference between unimodal
	NWT and WNT conditions. Mesial frontal and parietal areas showed
	larger MRCP to the bimodal condition than either unimodal or NWNT
	conditions. The parietal cortex was the only region that showed a
	difference between unimodal conditions with greater amplitude for
	NWT condition. Information concerning added sensory demand is processed
	by the motor cortex in a way that may be indifferent to the type
	of modality, but is influenced by the quantity of modalities at the
	level of the knee. Other brain structures such as parietal and premotor
	cortices respond based on the modality type to help plan appropriate
	strategies for motor control in response to sensory manipulations.
	This suggests that additional task demands in motor training may
	create a rich sensory environment that may be beneficial in promoting
	optimal neuromotor recovery.},

	through reconsolidation, in which previously consolidated memories
	can re-enter a temporary state of instability through retrieval,

	observed in other memory domains [5, 6], it is unknown whether reconsolidation
	leads to strengthened motor skills over multiple episodes of practice.
	Using a novel intervention after the retrieval of a consolidated
	skill, we found that skill can be modified and enhanced through exposure
	to increased sensorimotor variability. This improvement was greatest
	in those participants who could rapidly adjust their sensorimotor
	output in response to the relatively large fluctuations presented
	during the intervention. Importantly, strengthening required the
	reactivation of the consolidated skill and time for changes to reconsolidate.
	These results provide a key demonstration that consolidated motor
	skills continue to change as needed through the remapping of motor
	command to action goal, with strong implications for rehabilitation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Virtual reality (VR) is a new promising computer-assisted
	technology to promote motor recovery in stroke patients. VR-induced
	neuroplasticity supporting locomotor recovery is not known. We investigated
	the effects of VR intervention on cortical reorganization and associated
	locomotor recovery in stroke patients. METHODS: Ten chronic stroke
	patients were assigned randomly to either the control group or the
	VR group. VR was designed to provide interactive real-life practice
	environments in which practice parameters can be individualized to
	optimize motor relearning. Laterality index (LI) in the regions of
	interests (ROIs) and locomotor recovery were measured before and
	after VR using functional MRI (fMRI) and standardized locomotor tests,
	respectively. The t test and nonparametric test were performed to
	compare the mean differences at P<0.05. RESULTS: There was a significant
	difference in the interval change in the LI score for the primary
	sensorimotor cortex (SMC) between the groups (P<0.05), indicating
	that VR practice produced a greater increase in LI for the control
	group. However, the interval changes in the other ROIs were not significantly
	different (P>0.05). Motor function was significantly improved after
	VR (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our novel findings suggest that VR could
	induce cortical reorganization from aberrant ipsilateral to contralateral
	SMC activation. This enhanced cortical reorganization might play
	an important role in recovery of locomotor function in patients with
	chronic stroke. This is the first fMRI study in the literature that
	provides evidence for neuroplasticity and associated locomotor recovery
	after VR.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Today, the brain-computer interface (BCI) community lacks
	a standard method to evaluate an online BCI's performance. Even the
	most commonly used metric, the information transfer rate (ITR), is
	often reported differently, even incorrectly, in many papers, which
	is not conducive to BCI research. This paper aims to point out many
	of the existing problems and give some suggestions and methods to
	overcome these problems. APPROACH: First, the preconditions inherent
	in ITR calculation based on Wolpaw's definition are summarized and
	several incorrect ITR calculations, which go against the preconditions,
	are indicated. Then, the issues affecting ITR estimation during the
	test of online BCI systems are discussed in detail. Finally, a task-oriented
	online BCI test platform was proposed, which may help BCI evaluations
	in real-world applications. MAIN RESULTS: The guidelines for ITR
	calculation in online BCIs testing are proposed. The platform executed
	in the Beijing BCI Competition 2010 shows that it can be used as
	a common way to compare the online performances (including the ITR)
	of existing BCI paradigms. SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed guidelines
	and task-oriented test platform may reduce the uncertainty and artifacts
	of online BCI performance evaluation; they provide a relatively objective
	way to compare different BCI's performances in real-world BCI applications,
	which is a forward step toward developing standards for BCI performance
	evaluation.},

  abstract = {In many laboratory visuo-motor decision tasks, subjects compensate
	for their own visuo-motor error, earning close to the maximum reward
	possible. To do so, they must combine information about the distribution
	of possible error with values associated with different movement
	outcomes. The optimal solution is a potentially difficult computation
	that presupposes knowledge of the probability density function (pdf)
	of visuo-motor error associated with each possible planned movement.
	It is unclear how the brain represents such pdfs or computes with
	them. In three experiments, we used a forced-choice method to reveal
	subjects' internal representations of their spatial visuo-motor error
	in a speeded reaching movement. Although subjects' objective distributions
	were unimodal, close to Gaussian, their estimated internal pdfs were
	typically multimodal and were better described as mixtures of a small
	number of distributions differing only in location and scale. Mixtures
	of a small number of uniform distributions outperformed other mixture
	distributions, including mixtures of Gaussians.},

  abstract = {Both acetylcholine (ACh) and theta oscillations are important for
	learning and memory, but the dynamic interaction between these two
	processes remains unclear. Recent advances in amperometry techniques
	have revealed phasic ACh releases in vivo. However, it is unknown
	whether phasic ACh release co-occurs with theta oscillations. We
	investigated this issue in the CA1 region of urethane-anesthetized
	male rats using amperometric and electrophysiological recordings.
	We found that ACh release was highly correlated with the appearance
	of both spontaneous and induced theta oscillations. Moreover, the
	maximal ACh release was observed around or slightly above the pyramidal
	layer. Interestingly, such release lagged behind theta initiation
	by 25-60 s. The slow ACh release profile was matched by the slow
	firing rate increase of a subset of medial-septal low-firing-rate
	neurons. Together, these results establish, for the first time, the
	in vivo coupling between phasic ACh release and theta oscillations
	on spatiotemporal scales much finer than previously known. These
	findings also suggest that phasic ACh is not required for theta initiation
	and may instead operate synergistically with theta oscillations to
	promote neural plasticity in the service of learning and memory.},

	in learning new motor skills. At present, it is not known whether
	these children employ a different set of brain regions than typically
	developing (TD) children during skilled motor practice. Using functional
	magnetic resonance imaging, we mapped brain activity associated with
	skilled motor practice of a trail-tracing task in 7 children with
	DCD and 7 age-matched controls (aged 8-12 years). We indexed change
	in motor performance as a reduction in tracing error from early practice
	to retention. Children with DCD showed less blood-oxygen-level-dependent
	signal as compared to TD children in a network of brain regions associated
	with skilled motor practice: bilateral inferior parietal lobules
	(Brodmann Area (BA) 40), right lingual gyrus (BA 18), right middle
	frontal gyrus (BA 9), left fusiform gyrus (BA 37), right cerebellar
	crus I, left cerebellar lobule VI, and left cerebellar lobule IX.
	While no statistically significant differences were detected, effect
	size testing revealed that children with DCD demonstrated poorer
	tracing accuracy than TD children at retention (d=0.48). Our results
	suggest that, compared to TD peers, children with DCD demonstrate
	under-activation in cerebellar-parietal and cerebellar-prefrontal
	networks and in brain regions associated with visual-spatial learning.
	These data suggest a neurobiological correlation with impaired learning
	of motor skills in children with DCD, which will need to be confirmed
	with a larger sample.},
