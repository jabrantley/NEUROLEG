There were a few issues related to training. The data is the same in all the train files but the parameters were changed a few times. It does not appear that the params were updated properly in the first few, but they are correct in the one with the latest date.

The model was also behaving incorrectly so for accurate results, it needs to be retrained or merged with new data.

Also added param file manually. Updated in GUI to do autmoatically
