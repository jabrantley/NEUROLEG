# NEUROLEG

For part of my PhD dissertation project, I developed a real-time EEG-based brain-machine interface that was used by lower limb amputees to control a custom powered-knee prosthesis. We recruited several below-the-knee amputees to participate in a two parts study: an offline study that used EEG, EMG, IMU-based motion capture, and fMRI to study the representation of the phantom limb; and a second study that focused on EEG-based closed-loop control. The detailed protocol and results of both are forthcoming. This repo provides the source code for the real-time EEG-based BMI. Here is a basic overview of the experiment/program:
